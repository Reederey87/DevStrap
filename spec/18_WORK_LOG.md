# Work Log

## Purpose

This file records concise end-of-cycle summaries for agent work that modifies the DevStrap codebase.

Each entry should be short and factual so future agents can quickly understand what changed, how it was validated, and what remains.

## Entry Format

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

Changed:
- <code/spec/docs changes>

- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 accepted) the recovery path now enforces the full producer-identity chain — `m.Snapshot.ProducedBy == m.ProducedBy` (a compactor signs its OWN snapshot; device B's payload can never ride device A's signature), the envelope must match the signed manifest on producer/epoch/kid/HLC, and the sealed document's own identity fields must match the envelope (defense in depth against a WCK-holding insider), pinned by `TestRecoverFromSnapshotRefusesForeignProducerSnapshot`; (P2 REJECTED with rationale) the tombstone import gate deliberately stays a bare-HLC comparison — the LIVE paths resolve equal-HLC add/delete ties in the tombstone's favor (applyEventTx blocks adds at `HLC <= tombstoneHLC`; `tombstonePath` keeps the max unconditionally), so the suggested full-coordinate tie-break would make import DIVERGE from replay, the exact property import exists to preserve (rationale pinned in a code comment); (P3) the recovery doc comment now states honestly that local store/keyring failures keep the default exit class.

- Post-review (Codex P1 + P3): the pre-delete read-back confirm is now a BYTE-FOR-BYTE comparison against the manifest bytes this device just CAS-wrote — a hostile hub that acks the CAS and serves back a forged manifest naming the same snapshot sha can no longer widen the deletion floors (deletion is gated on the confirmed bytes); the roundtrip txtar additionally asserts no event carrier remains in the log after compaction (cold objects actually GONE, not merely unreadable).

Validated:
- <commands or checks run>

Follow-ups:
- <remaining work, or "None">
```

Entries are newest-first: each code-modifying cycle prepends ONE dated entry at the top.

## 2026-07-13 — fix(release): stable-smoke needs write access to see a still-draft release

Changed:
- Found live during the first production dry-run of the P7-QUAL-01 staged-promotion pipeline: `v0.1.2-rc.1` verified clean, but the `v0.1.2` stable tag's `stable-smoke` job failed on both macOS and Linux runners with `gh release download` reporting `release not found` (404). Root cause, confirmed by reproducing the same `gh release download` call locally with a personal write-capable token against the same draft release (it succeeded instantly): GitHub's draft-release visibility model requires push/write access to view a draft via the API — a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` (the job had `permissions: { contents: read }`) 404s on it even though the draft exists, and (per adversarial review) the same restriction applies to the "list releases" endpoint too (a read-only token just gets drafts silently omitted rather than erroring), so there is no narrower read-scoped fix.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: `stable-smoke`'s `permissions` bumped from `contents: read` to `contents: write`, matching the precedent already established by `stable-publish` (which successfully calls `gh release view` against the same still-draft release under `contents: write`). Corrected the step's wrong comment ("authenticated tag lookup can see repository drafts") to state the actual requirement.
- Recovery: the stuck `v0.1.2` draft release and its pushed tag were deleted (`gh release delete`, `git push --delete origin v0.1.2`) per `RELEASING.md`'s documented failed-smoke recovery procedure; `v0.1.2-rc.1` is unaffected (the rc flow publishes immediately and never hits the draft-visibility gate) and stays published as the verified rc artifact.
- Filed #177, then fixed in this same PR after CodeRabbit review correctly noted the new `contents: write` scope sharpens the existing execute-before-verify ordering: the single "Download and verify staged release" step is now split into four token-minimized steps — `Download staged release` (the only step with `GH_TOKEN`, outputs `archive`/`version` via `GITHUB_OUTPUT`), `Verify checksums, SBOM, and completions`, `Verify cosign signature and SLSA provenance`, and `Extract and smoke-test the verified binary` (runs last, token-free, only reached once every prior verification step has passed). #177 stays open only as the historical record of the finding; the fix landed here rather than as a separate future PR.

Validated:
- Live reproduction of the failure and the fix's precondition (personal write-capable `gh auth` succeeded against the same draft that the read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` 404'd on).
- `actionlint .github/workflows/release.yml` clean; `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"` parses.
- Dual review: Grok-4.5 (mechanical fix + validation), Codex adversarial review (confirmed no narrower permission fix exists via GitHub's documented list-endpoint draft-visibility restriction; validated the `stable-publish` precedent), CodeRabbit (flagged the execute-before-verify sharpening as Major; addressed by the step split above rather than deferred).

Follow-ups:
- Re-cut `v0.1.2` once this fix merges, and re-run the staged pipeline end-to-end to complete the wave's live release dry-run.

## 2026-07-12 — docs: truth-up service-installer and OS-sandbox claims across six files (P7-DOC-01)

Changed:
- Six files described two shipped capabilities as unbuilt/future/advisory; corrected to match the code and each file's own already-shipped statements. Both capabilities: `devstrap service install|uninstall|status` (launchd LaunchAgent / systemd `--user` unit wrapping `run-loop`, `P4-PROD-04`, 2026-07-06) and the OS-enforced agent sandbox (macOS Seatbelt default, Linux bubblewrap → Landlock+seccomp fallback, `P4-GIT-03`, 2026-07-05).
- `spec/00_START_HERE.md`: Phase-3 list parenthetical now states the OS-enforced sandbox shipped; the near-term-direction sentence moves `P4-GIT-03` out of "remaining candidates" (leaving only the later `AD-1` slices); the "Not implemented yet" list drops the sandbox clause (project-env allowlists + non-generic engine adapters stay).
- `spec/06_LINUX_COMPATIBILITY.md`: the two "deferred `service install`" references in the `P6-XP-04` problem/steps now say it shipped (`P4-PROD-04`), consistent with the file's own §"systemd user service — shipped" heading.
- Assembly additions (2026-07-12, same finding): `spec/03` §platform-adapters no longer claims "service installers are still design targets" (daemon + FSEvents watcher keep that status; the shipped managers are named); `spec/05`'s later-layers framing carves out the shipped LaunchAgent; and the `P7-XP-04` APFS wording correction that raced #169's auto-merge lands here — `spec/11`, the ignore.go/ignore_test.go comments, the ledger row, and the #169 work-log entry now say APFS is normalization-PRESERVING (the NFD sources being HFS+ legacy volumes, archives, network filesystems, and NFD-writing apps) instead of "APFS readdir returns NFD".
- `spec/10_AGENT_WORKSPACES_AND_POLICIES.md`: the wrapper-policy heading and the two "later: sandbox/container" bullets now describe the wrapper as guardrails layered *beneath* the shipped OS sandbox, with containerization as the residual later slice (matching the file's own detailed shipped-sandbox paragraph).
- `spec/15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`: the agent-controls "OS sandbox before public release" item now cites the shipped sandbox, consistent with the file's own §"Security decisions" shipped note.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: the Linux-confinement "next slice / advisory" paragraph now states both platforms are OS-sandboxed; the "deliberately not built" daemon item drops the installer clause (daemon/socket/FSEvents stay unbuilt).
- `docs/quickstart.md`: the sandbox note now covers macOS Seatbelt AND Linux bubblewrap → Landlock+seccomp, with the wrapper policy framed as guardrails beneath.
- `last_reviewed` bumped to 2026-07-11 on the four touched `spec/` files; the daemon/`devstrapd` (socket API, FSEvents watcher) references were left unchanged (genuinely unbuilt).

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (docs-only; no Go tests).

## 2026-07-12 — ci(release): stage-then-promote stable releases (P7-QUAL-01)

Changed:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` + `.goreleaser.yaml`: stable tags are built ONCE and staged as a DRAFT (GoReleaser `release.draft: true` — the field is a non-templateable bool, so rc tags keep their single-phase behavior via an immediate publish step in the goreleaser job), the Homebrew cask renders but does not push (`skip_upload` templated on `DEVSTRAP_STAGE_ONLY`), SLSA provenance attaches to the draft (the generator's `draft-release` input — a STRING with tri-state semantics: 'true'/non-empty/empty — receives 'true' for stable and EMPTY for rc so an already-published rc release is left untouched), a native ubuntu+macos `stable-smoke` matrix verifies the exact staged bytes (version/commit/date output, completions, checksums via sha256sum-or-shasum, per-archive SBOMs, cosign identity pin, slsa-verifier with `--source-tag`), and only then does `stable-publish` flip the draft public and push the ALREADY-RENDERED cask (workflow-artifact-passed) to the tap with an identical-content guard. No rebuild between smoke and publish — the artifacts users get are the artifacts CI executed and verified.
- Promotion safety: release runs are serialized per tag (`concurrency: release-${{ github.ref }}`, never cancelled), the publish job refuses a draft whose `targetCommitish` is not the smoked commit (the delete-and-re-cut tag TOCTOU fails loudly instead of publishing un-smoked bytes), every fallible prep step (artifact download, tap clone/auth) runs BEFORE the user-visible draft flip, and tap pushes serialize across all runs (`homebrew-tap-publish` group). GoReleaser exact-pinned to v2.17.0; new upload/download-artifact actions SHA-pinned and verified against upstream.
- `RELEASING.md`: staged-promotion flow, the failed-smoke draft+tag delete/re-cut procedure, the residual published-but-tap-failed window and its recovery (re-run `stable-publish` or hand-push the retained artifact cask — never regenerate), the version-order note; `GORELEASER_CURRENT_TAG` and the 0-or-5 `MACOS_*` gate notes preserved. `spec/03`: the distribution pipeline items updated to the staged flow.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-QUAL-01` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 19→18 open (P2 6→5).

Validated:
- `goreleaser check` (v2.17.0) clean; stable-snapshot AND unset-env snapshot builds (skip_upload renders "true" vs "auto"; cask path confirmed `dist/homebrew/Casks/devstrap.rb`); actionlint v1.7.12 clean; YAML parse; checksums verified with both sha256sum and shasum locally; extracted native binary reports version/commit/date.
- NOT yet live-proven: the staged pipeline needs one rc + one stable tag dry-run (`v0.1.2-rc.1` → `v0.1.2`) — a maintainer decision (user-visible artifacts); until then the finding is shipped-code, pending-live-verification, mirroring how cosign/SLSA shipped (P4-SEC-05) before their `v0.1.1` live proof.
- Provenance: implemented by Codex (gpt-5.6) from a line-level coordinator spec (it empirically resolved the three flagged design unknowns: draft non-templateability, the SLSA generator's draft-release support, GoReleaser v2.17.0 as actual latest); coordinator (fable-5) line-by-line review; adversarial Codex review found 4 (P1 string-typed draft-release input — the coordinator's own boolean coercion, from a mis-grepped neighboring input, would have failed call-site validation; P1 tag TOCTOU; P2 publish-before-tap ordering; P2 cross-tag tap race) — all fixed pre-PR.

Follow-ups:
- Live dry-run of the staged pipeline on the next real release (`v0.1.2-rc.1` → `v0.1.2`).

## 2026-07-12 — ci: live service e2e gate + fuzz-smoke coverage (P7-QUAL-04, P7-QUAL-06)

Changed:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: new `service-e2e` matrix (ubuntu-latest + macos-latest, PR + push like the test job) exercising the REAL launchd/systemd user manager end to end: build the binary, init an isolated home (file custody via `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1`), `service install` with a collision-resistant CI-only label and `--hub-file`, poll `service status --json` to running, cross-check the OS truth (`systemctl --user is-active` / `launchctl print gui/<uid>/…`), assert `doctor` (via a briefly-installed default-label twin — doctor inspects only the OS default label — with pre-assertion that the default label is absent, ownership tracking, and owned-only cleanup), uninstall + OS-truth absence, and the Linux HEADLESS-uninstall regression (`env -u DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS -u XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, asserting exit 0, unit file gone, and the P7-XP-03 advisory text). Trap-based cleanup preserves the failing exit code and dumps unit/manager/journal/run-loop-log diagnostics only on failure.
- P7-QUAL-06: `FuzzParseBytes` (`internal/envfile`) and `FuzzCompile` (`internal/ignore`) join the CI fuzz smoke, mirroring the existing 30s `FuzzDecideConvergence` step.
- Drive-by (actionlint cleanliness): the MinIO wait loop's unused index variable.
- `spec/16`: the live service/fuzz gate documented in the Phase 0 suite list.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-QUAL-04` + `P7-QUAL-06` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 21→19 open (P2 7→6, P3 14→13).

Validated:
- `actionlint` v1.7.12 clean; YAML parse; both fuzz targets executed locally (10s each: 1.2M execs / 126 new corpus entries for ParseBytes, 570K / 260 for Compile).
- The full macOS leg executed LIVE locally against real launchd pre-push: install → running (JSON + `launchctl print`) → doctor "installed and running" → uninstall → unloaded, with both plists confirmed absent afterwards and the run-loop log showing real ticks then a clean stop.
- Provenance: implemented by Codex (gpt-5.6) from a line-level coordinator spec. Two spec errors were caught by execution and reported as deviations: the spec's init argv double-passed the root (real syntax verified against the binary) and `doctor` inspects only the default label (solved with the ownership-tracked twin). Coordinator (fable-5) line-by-line review; Codex review pre-merge; the linux leg runs first in this PR's own CI.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 fixed) a live supervisor is not a working loop — run-loop swallows the first four tick failures, so every prior assertion passed with a service failing quietly for 30 minutes; the job now requires an OBSERVED first tick (the tick-header progress line) with no `run-loop tick error` in the service stderr log, checked before the doctor twin exists so the shared maintenance lock cannot false-fail it (re-validated live on real launchd). (P3 fixed) spec/16's Mac/Linux sections no longer claim the live launchd/systemd e2e "remains manual" — both point at the `service-e2e` legs.

Follow-ups:
- The `service-e2e` job is not yet in the branch-protection required-check set — maintainer decision after it proves stable.
- Observed while wiring the tick gate: on Linux the CLI's install confirmation prints the `run-loop.*.log` paths, but the rendered systemd unit has no `StandardOutput=`/`StandardError=` — output goes to journald (the status hint already says `journalctl`), so those files never exist under systemd. Candidate small fix: either render `StandardError=append:` targets or drop the misleading log-path line on Linux.

## 2026-07-12 — fix(cli): key-custody gate at service install (P7-XP-02)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/service.go` `checkServiceInstallCustody` (new, called before exec-path resolution): a pre-init store preserves today's behavior; file custody proceeds silently; unrecorded custody warns (`devstrap init` remedy, printed even under `--quiet`); recorded keychain custody is REFUSED on systemd (`exitInvalidConfig`, no-session-D-Bus/restart-loop rationale, migrate-to-file remedy) unless the new `--allow-keychain-custody` is passed, and warns on launchd (locked-keychain-until-first-GUI-login risk). A live `Probe` under the installing session only sharpens the text ("unreachable even in this session") — behavior classes key off the RECORDED custody, and the probe is skipped entirely on an explicit systemd opt-in. When `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` is what makes custody effectively file-backed, that explicit non-secret override is baked into the unit's env so the service behaves like the installing session instead of stranding — the no-silent-downgrade rule holds (the installer never invents the override).
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: `checkService` (now store-threaded) appends a `run-loop service custody` warning in every installed-service branch when effective custody is keychain, with systemd-specific D-Bus detail and the migrate/`--allow-keychain-custody` remedies.
- `internal/platform/service_linux.go`: carry-along from #166's CodeRabbit review — the reachable-manager `daemon-reload` failure now preserves the "unit file removed" context in its error.
- Tests: eight `TestServiceInstall*` custody cases (refusal, explicit-flag allow, launchd warn, unreachable-now sharpening, file-silent, effective-file bake into the unit env, unset warn, pre-init preservation) + doctor custody warn coverage + the daemon-reload message test updates.
- `spec/05` + `spec/06` + `spec/13`: the install-time gate, the launchd warn, the doctor fold, and the explicit-override bake documented (spec/06's "installer does not auto-bake" paragraph rewritten — the rule it protected, no SILENT downgrade, is preserved).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-XP-02` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 22→21 open (P2 8→7).

Validated:
- `gofmt`; `golangci-lint run` (0 issues); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli/ ./internal/platform/ -count=1`; full `go test -race ./... -count=1`.
- Provenance: implemented by Codex (gpt-5.6) from a line-level coordinator spec (clean run; its own dual self-review moved the probe behind the opt-in early-return and added the bake — both kept); coordinator (fable-5) line-by-line review; Codex review pre-merge.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 fixed) the explicit `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` override now survives a PRE-INIT install too — both no-database branches previously returned bake=false, so init-later-with-keychain-custody produced a unit whose runtime custody differed from the installing session (pinned by `TestServiceInstallPreInitStillBakesExplicitOverride`); (P2 fixed) an unknown recorded custody value is refused as corrupt state (`exitInvalidConfig`, re-init remedy) instead of failing open through the gate while `HybridStore` silently re-enabled the file fallback (pinned by `TestServiceInstallRefusesCorruptRecordedCustody`, raw-SQL-corrupted store); (P3 fixed) the unset-custody warning now precedes the effective-file early return, so the override no longer silences the pre-P6-XP-04 remedy (pinned by `TestServiceInstallUnsetCustodyWarnsEvenWithOverride`, which also asserts the bake); (P3 fixed) the reachable-manager reload-failure error distinguishes a real removal from an ENOENT no-op ("no unit file was present to remove", pinned); (P3 fixed) spec/13's no-secret rationale updated — the CLI supplies at most the fixed non-secret custody flag, the adapters add only PATH.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(ignore): NFC-normalized matching + documented case sensitivity (P7-XP-04, P7-XP-06)

Changed:
- `internal/ignore/ignore.go`: `parseLine` NFC-normalizes every pattern line at compile (after gitignore trailing-whitespace stripping; `!`/`/`/`#` and all ASCII metacharacters are NFC-invariant, and `p.text` — which feeds `GitignoreFragment` — becomes the normalized form, so compile → fragment → recompile is a fixed point), and `Match` NFC-normalizes the target after `filepath.ToSlash` (`ShouldPruneDir` flows through `Match`, including the empty-relSlash name fallback). `norm.NFC.String` returns already-NFC input unchanged without allocating, so the ASCII path is free. Same normalization `internal/pathkey` has always applied to namespace keys; `golang.org/x/text` was already a dependency.
- Tests (explicit `\u00e9` vs `e\u0301` literals so nothing depends on source normalization): `TestMatchNFCPatternMatchesNFDPath` (+ dirOnly descendant), `TestMatchNFDPatternMatchesNFCPath`, `TestShouldPruneDirNFDName` (+ name fallback), `TestGitignoreFragmentEmitsNFC` (round-trip), `TestNegationWinsAfterNormalization`.
- `spec/11`: new "Unicode normalization and case sensitivity" section — the NFC guarantee (P7-XP-04; wording corrected in the P7-DOC-01 truth-up: APFS is normalization-preserving, the NFD sources are HFS+ legacy/archives/network-fs/NFD-writing apps — the "APFS readdir returns NFD" over-claim, caught by the #169 Codex review, raced that PR's auto-merge) and the DELIBERATE fleet-portable case-sensitivity (P7-XP-06, resolved as documentation per the audit's preferred fix): git's `core.ignorecase=true` divergence on macOS is acknowledged, per-OS folding rejected as reintroducing exactly the divergence NFC removes, and the contrast with case-folding `path_key` (namespace identity vs content matching) drawn.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-XP-04` + `P7-XP-06` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 counts re-derived from the table at merge (serial wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/ignore/ ./internal/scan/ ./internal/sync/ -count=1`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; full `go test -race ./... -count=1`.
- Provenance: implemented by Grok (grok-4.5) from a line-level coordinator spec; coordinator (fable-5) line-by-line review + the spec/11 section; Codex review pre-merge.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(installer): authenticate shipped checksums and provenance (P7-QUAL-02)

Changed:
- `scripts/install.sh` now downloads `checksums.txt.sigstore.json` and verifies the checksum file with cosign pinned to the exact DevStrap release-workflow identity before any archive hash is trusted. Missing cosign and missing bundles fail closed by default; `DEVSTRAP_INSTALL_CHECKSUM_ONLY=1` is an explicit loud-warning escape hatch (bundle absence is accepted only on a confirmed 404). The existing sha256 verification remains always on and unchanged after the new signature stage.
- The installer downloads `multiple.intoto.jsonl` and verifies the selected archive against `github.com/Reederey87/DevStrap` at the selected tag, FAIL-CLOSED like cosign: a missing `slsa-verifier` refuses the install with an install hint, `DEVSTRAP_INSTALL_NO_SLSA=1` is the explicit provenance-only waiver, and under `CHECKSUM_ONLY` the provenance layer degrades to opportunistic.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds installer ShellCheck coverage and a push-to-main Ubuntu/macOS latest-release installer smoke with cosign, including an Ubuntu fail-closed negative run with cosign removed from `PATH`.
- `docs/install.md` documents automatic verification, both environment controls, fail-closed behavior, and the tag-pinned installer URL for high-assurance use. `RELEASING.md` adds positive and no-cosign-negative tag-installer release smokes. Specs 03/16 record the distribution contract and CI coverage; the audit ledger moves `P7-QUAL-02` to *Recently shipped* (counts re-derived from the table at merge — serial wave).

Validated:
- `shellcheck scripts/install.sh`; `bash -n scripts/install.sh`; `gofmt -w cmd internal`.
- Live end-to-end against the real `v0.1.1` release (2026-07-11, this session, cosign 3.x + slsa-verifier via brew): positive run prints `Signature verified (cosign, release workflow identity).` + `SLSA provenance verified.` + `Checksum verified.` and the installed binary reports `devstrap 0.1.1`; negative run with `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` refuses with the exact `cosign not found` message; `DEVSTRAP_INSTALL_CHECKSUM_ONLY=1` under the same stripped PATH proceeds with the loud WARNING.
- Review pass (Grok, Minors fixed): the CI no-cosign negative test now asserts the refusal REASON (greps `cosign not found`) instead of any non-zero exit; cosign/slsa-verifier stderr is surfaced on failure instead of discarded; the checksum-only-hatch wording and docs now state precisely which layers remain (SLSA still runs when the bundle exists and slsa-verifier is present; a pre-bundle 404 skips SLSA too); redundant `continue-on-error: false` dropped; `sigstore/cosign-installer` SHA-pinned.
- Provenance: ported from the interrupted prior session's `fix/p7-qual-02-installer-verify` branch; coordinator (fable-5) re-reviewed the full diff line-by-line, rebased over the P7-DATA/P7-XP-03 waves, and re-derived the ledger.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 fixed) SLSA verification is now fail-closed like cosign — the audit's contract said "cosign + SLSA" and a silent skip on a missing verifier made `DEVSTRAP_INSTALL_NO_SLSA=1` meaningless; the smoke job installs slsa-verifier (pinned `go install …@v2.7.1`). (P3 fixed) the bundle 404-probe is now ONE request (status + body from the same transfer), so a transient 5xx can no longer be misclassified as "no bundle" and silently skip both layers under the hatch. (P3 fixed) the CI smokes execute the documented `sh` path (dash on Ubuntu) instead of `bash`. (P3 fixed) the high-assurance docs recipe now binds one `tag` variable to both the raw-script URL and `DEVSTRAP_VERSION` (the previous literal `<vX.Y.Z>` block neither ran as written nor pinned the binary release).

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(cli,platform): stable service ExecPath + missing-ExecPath detection (P7-XP-01, P7-XP-05)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/service.go` `resolveServiceExecPath` (split as `resolveServiceExecPathFrom` with an injectable `evalSymlinks` seam): the ephemeral check still runs on the RESOLVED target first (a stable-dir symlink can never bless a `$TMPDIR`/`go-build` binary); when the INVOKED path sits in a stable install bin dir (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin` — `stableServiceBinDirs`, exact cleaned-dir equality) the symlink itself is baked unresolved so `brew upgrade` moving the Cellar target cannot brick the unit; a path that still resolves into a segment-aware `/Cellar/` is refused (`exitInvalidConfig`) with a stable-symlink/`--exec-path` remedy; anything else keeps today's resolved-path behavior.
- `internal/platform`: `ServiceStatus` gains `ExecPath`/`ExecPathMissing`; both `Status` impls best-effort parse the installed unit's launch binary — launchd via a bounded `encoding/xml` tokenizer over our own rendered `ProgramArguments` (`extractLaunchdExecPath`, `service_launchd.go`), systemd via `systemdUnquoteFirstWord` (the exact inverse of `systemdQuote`: `\\`/`\"` unescape then `%%`→`%`, `service_systemd.go`) — and prepend `ExecPath missing: <path>` to the detail when the binary is gone; a hand-mangled file degrades to an unknown ExecPath, never an error.
- `internal/cli`: `service status` reports `exec:`/`(MISSING — re-run 'devstrap service install')` and the `--json` shape gains `exec_path`/`exec_path_missing`; `doctor`'s `checkService` warns with a re-run remedy when the ExecPath is missing (takes precedence over the generic installed-but-stopped warn — a still-running process whose binary was deleted also warns).
- Tests: stable-symlink preference, Cellar refusal, ephemeral-wins-over-stable, explicit `--exec-path` passthrough (`TestResolveServiceExecPathPrefersStableSymlinkDir`); per-OS `TestServiceStatusReportsMissingExecPath` incl. mangled-file degradation; golden-plist extraction; `systemdQuote` round-trip (spaces/quotes/backslashes/`%`); JSON + human status; doctor warn.
- `spec/05` + `spec/06` + `spec/13`: the stable-symlink/Cellar contract and ExecPath-missing surfacing documented.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-XP-01` + `P7-XP-05` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 counts re-derived (27→25 open; P2 11→10, P3 16→15).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...` + `go vet ./internal/platform/`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli/ ./internal/platform/ -count=1`; full `go test -race ./... -count=1`. Linux-tagged tests execute in CI's ubuntu job.
- Provenance: implemented by Codex (gpt-5.6) from a line-level coordinator spec (clean run, one declared test-fixture deviation — the stable-to-Cellar case uses the injected seam with a synthetic path, since a real `t.TempDir()` target would correctly trip the ephemeral refusal first); coordinator (fable-5) line-by-line review; rebased over `P7-XP-03` (kept both PRs' spec/13 bullets and both linux test blocks); Codex review pre-merge.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 fixed) the stable-path exception now also covers Linuxbrew's `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` and the keg-only/versioned-formula entrypoint `<brew prefix>/opt/<formula>/bin` (upgrade-stable symlinks that RESOLVE into Cellar and were being refused although a versioned formula may have no global bin link at all — `isStableBrewOptBin`, exact `<prefix>/opt/<one segment>/bin` shape); pinned by the keg-only sub-test incl. deeper/shallower non-matching opt paths. (P3 fixed) `extractLaunchdExecPath` no longer accepts a descendant array/string: the key's IMMEDIATE value must be the array and its FIRST direct child must be a `<string>` — any other well-formed shape degrades to an unknown ExecPath instead of returning a string from the wrong nested value; pinned by `TestExtractLaunchdExecPathRejectsForeignShapes` (dict-wrapped value, nested-array-first, empty array, foreign plist). Also from the lint gate: an untagged `TestExtractSystemdExecPath` (the helper is linux-only-called but lives untagged) and gosec nolints justifying the two own-unit `os.ReadFile`s.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(platform): headless systemd service uninstall (P7-XP-03)

Changed:
- `internal/platform/platform.go`: `ServiceManager.Uninstall` now returns advisory notes (mirroring `Install`) so the CLI never branches on the OS; `UnsupportedServiceManager` updated.
- `internal/platform/service_linux.go`: `Uninstall` no longer bails on an unreachable `--user` manager — best-effort `disable --now` and `daemon-reload` run only when the manager is reachable, the unit file is ALWAYS removed (launchd parity), and an advisory note names the finish-from-a-session commands when the manager was unreachable and a unit file was actually removed (a headless uninstall of a never-installed service stays a note-free no-op).
- `internal/platform/service_darwin.go` + the cli test fake: signature parity, no behavior change.
- `internal/cli/service.go`: uninstall prints notes verbatim (even under `--quiet`), exactly like install.
- Tests: `TestSystemdUninstallRemovesUnitFileWhenManagerUnreachable`, `TestSystemdUninstallDeadBusStillRemovesUnit`, `TestSystemdUninstallHeadlessNotInstalledIsNoteFreeNoOp`, `TestSystemdUninstallReachableManagerKeepsFullSequence`.
- `spec/06` + `spec/13`: the headless-uninstall contract documented (install keeps failing closed; removal must not).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-XP-03` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 counts re-derived from the table (28→27 open; P2 12→11).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...` + `GOOS=linux go vet ./internal/platform/`; native `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/platform/ ./internal/cli/ -count=1`; full `go test -race ./...`. The linux-tagged uninstall tests execute in CI's ubuntu job (Docker unavailable locally this run).
- Provenance: implemented by Grok (grok-4.5) from a line-level coordinator spec (the job's stopReason read "Cancelled" but the diff was complete and spec-faithful — verified from git state per the standing trust-git-status rule); coordinator (fable-5) line-by-line review added the removed-nothing note suppression; Codex review pre-merge.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 fixed) a canceled/expired context now aborts BEFORE any removal — `available()` classifies `context.Canceled` as "manager unreachable", so the headless path would otherwise delete the unit file of an uninstall the caller already gave up on (pinned by `TestSystemdUninstallCanceledContextRemovesNothing`); (P2 fixed) a real `disable --now` failure is no longer silently masked — the adapter probes `is-active` and, only when the service is provably still running, returns a still-active advisory alongside the (still-removed) unit file, so the CLI can never print a bare "uninstalled" over a live service (pinned by `TestSystemdUninstallStillActiveAfterDisableFailureGetsAdvisory`); (P3 fixed) spec/13's "all three exit non-zero on an unsupported platform/session" sentence no longer contradicts the headless-uninstall paragraph (narrowed to unsupported platforms; session-unreachable keeps status/uninstall working); (P3 fixed) the CLI-boundary uninstall-notes path is now regression-pinned including under `--quiet` (`TestServiceUninstallPrintsAdapterNotesEvenQuiet`, fake gains `uninstallNotes`).

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(cli): journaled all-or-nothing restore promotion + maintenance lock (P7-DATA-05)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/restore_journal.go` (new): restore promotion is one journaled transaction. A durable `.restore-journal.json` (atomic temp+fsync+rename + directory sync; pid/hostname/started-at + per-target staged/existed/done) is published BEFORE the first rename; every existing target moves aside under ONE shared `.bak-<pid>-<nanos>` suffix before any staged target promotes; each promote is durably recorded before the next; asides are swept and the journal removed ONLY after every target is Done. `recoverRestoreJournal` rolls FORWARD only from a durably all-Done journal (finish sweeping) and otherwise rolls BACK in reverse to the exact pre-restore state — including the crash-between-rename-and-record case — validating filesystem invariants first and retaining the journal fail-closed on damage or a crafted/unsafe journal (suffix shape validated; no slashes). A failed final journal sync whose commit record already published is detected by recovery rolling forward — the restore completed.
- Hooks: `opts.openState` fences every command on a pending journal (double-stat straddling the open); `db restore --recover` (archive arg optional) completes-or-reverses an interrupted swap; plain restore auto-recovers first; `doctor` reports a pending journal.
- Maintenance lock: restore, full backup, `db down`, and the run-loop tick serialize on a state-level maintenance lock (repo-lock primitive, P7-GIT-03 identity semantics; dead-PID break pinned by test). This CLOSES the `db down` check-vs-Down cross-process residual documented in the P7-DATA-07 entry (`internal/state/store.go` guard comment updated to past tense).
- Tests: 13 named unit tests (all-or-nothing rollback incl. dangling-symlink pre-state, invariant-damage retention, openState/doctor fences, lock conflicts incl. db down + full backup, dead-PID lock break, plain-restore auto-recovery, `--recover` JSON purity, unsafe-journal no-mutation, rollback-failure journal retention) + e2e `db_restore_journal_recovery.txtar`.
- `spec/13` + `spec/12` + `spec/15` + `spec/16`: journal/lock/recover contract documented.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-DATA-05` moved open → *Recently shipped*; counts re-derived at merge (serial wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state/ ./internal/cli/ -count=1`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./cmd/devstrap -run 'TestScript/db_' -count=1`.
- Provenance: ported from the interrupted prior session's `fix/p7-data-backup-hardening` (DATA-05 slice) by Codex (gpt-5.6); coordinator (fable-5) deep review walked the crash matrix (mid-aside, promote-without-record, all-Done-unswept, damaged journal, journal-write-failure-after-commit) — no findings.
- Post-review (CodeRabbit): four minors fixed — spec/16's AD-7 DIRECTION now marks `db backup --full`/`db restore` shipped (workspace-manifest export/import stays future scope); every `writeRestoreJournal` failure path wraps its error with context (it is the durability backbone); the unparseable-JSON and fails-safety-invariants journal refusals carry distinct messages; and the unsafe-journal test now asserts the rejected journal is byte-for-byte untouched and `home` gained no stray entries.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 fixed) the ROLLBACK path is now itself crash-resumable — each reversed target is durably recorded (`rolled_back`) before the loop continues, so a crash or partial failure mid-rollback no longer leaves a journal whose satisfied invariants read as damage (which previously wedged recovery behind manual repair); resumed recovery skips reversed targets. Pinned by `TestRecoverRestoreJournalResumesInterruptedRollback` (injected rename failure on the second target; second run resumes and completes to the exact pre-state).

Follow-ups:
- None.
## 2026-07-11 — fix(cli): versioned backup manifest + fail-closed restore verification (P7-DATA-04)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/db_backup.go`: full-backup archives now carry a `manifest.json` (format `devstrap-full-backup` v1: per-entry name/size/SHA-256, required set, workspace/device/custody metadata) written as the final tar entry while every other entry streams through a SHA-256 tee; referenced blobs are additionally re-verified against their content address during backup. `db restore` fails closed BEFORE any swap: manifest entries hash-verified against the stage, unlisted extras refused, missing/short archives refused; pre-manifest archives are refused unless `--allow-legacy` (`internal/cli/db.go`), and even legacy restores run the completeness probe. `verifyRestoreCompleteness` cross-checks the STAGED DB (opened read-only) — every referenced blob staged and hash-matching, device identity + signing key files present, held WCK epoch key files present — so a "successful" restore can no longer be unrecoverable.
- `internal/state/store.go`: `OpenSnapshot` (read-only, immutable, `query_only` DSN — no WAL side files) + `ValidateDBFileReadOnly` so staged-DB validation cannot mutate manifest-verified bytes. **P7-DATA-03 completion:** `snapshotAndEnumerate` keeps the snapshot Store open and backup reads blob refs, custody, current device, workspace id, and held WCK epochs all from the same frozen row-set (the audit's "snapshot as authority for every archive decision"), pinned by the `backupAfterSnapshot` seam.
- Tests: `TestFullBackupManifestHashesEveryEntryAndIsLast`, `TestRestoreRejectsTamperedEntriesBeforeSwap`, `TestRestoreRejectsMissingOrShortArchiveBeforeSwap`, `TestRestoreLegacyPolicyAndCompleteness`, `TestRestoreCompletenessRequiresHeldWCKFile`, `TestFullBackupRejectsCorruptContentAddressedBlob`, `TestFullBackupFailsWhenSnapshotHeldWCKDisappearsFromLiveCustody`, `TestOpenSnapshotIsReadOnlyAndCreatesNoWALSideFiles`, `TestOpenSnapshotFreezesBlobRefs`; e2e `db_restore_verify.txtar` + existing `db_full_backup_restore.txtar` extended.
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` + `spec/12_DATA_MODEL_SQLITE.md`: archive layout gains the manifest row; restore contract documents fail-closed verification and `--allow-legacy`.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-DATA-04` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 counts re-derived from the table at merge (serial wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state/ ./internal/cli/ -count=1`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./cmd/devstrap -run 'TestScript/db_' -count=1`.
- Provenance: ported from the interrupted prior session's `fix/p7-data-backup-hardening` combined branch (its DATA-04 slice), adapted by Codex (gpt-5.6) onto the shipped PR-#162 DATA-03 base; coordinator line-by-line review.

- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 fixed) the completeness probe now validates key material SEMANTICALLY, not just by presence — the staged device identity and signing key are parsed and their derived public halves compared against the archived database's device row, and each held WCK is base64-decoded, length-checked (32 bytes), and its SHA-256 verified against the recorded kid fingerprint; pinned by `TestRestoreRefusesSemanticallyInvalidKeyMaterial` (a parseable-but-wrong age key refuses the restore via the legacy path, where the manifest hash cannot catch it). (P3 fixed) the rebase-duplicated Pass-7 ledger summary paragraphs were removed across every open wave branch.
- Post-review (opus, dual-review): MERGE-READY; two dispositions — (fixed) `manifest.Required` was tautological (mirrored from `Entries`), it is now set independently to the recoverable core (`state.db` + the device age/signing key files) so the verify-side subset check is a real guarantee; (accepted, documented) the manifest is in-archive and unsigned — it detects corruption/truncation, not tampering; authenticity rests on the completeness probe + DB validation, and the prose deliberately does not claim tamper-resistance.

Follow-ups:
- P7-DATA-05 (journaled all-or-nothing promotion + `db restore --recover`) ports next from the same reference branch.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(cli): db backup --full enumerates blob refs from the snapshot; missing blob fatal (P7-DATA-03)

Changed:
- `internal/state/store.go`: `AllBlobRefs` query extracted into a shared `allBlobRefs(ctx, querier)`; new exported `AllBlobRefsInFile(ctx, path)` opens a standalone snapshot/backup DB (same open path as `validateBackup`) so backup decisions read the frozen row-set, not the live store.
- `internal/cli/db_backup.go`: `runFullBackup` replaces the live-store enumeration with `snapshotAndEnumerate` — up to `backupSnapshotAttempts` (3) VACUUM INTO + enumerate-from-snapshot + stat-every-ciphertext passes; a concurrent rotation/GC that deletes a superseded blob is healed by the fresh snapshot on the next attempt (drift injectable via the `backupEnumerateHook` test seam), while refs still missing after the last attempt are a hard `exitConflict` naming every ref (was: warn-and-skip with `missing_blobs` in the JSON result — a "successful" archive silently omitting referenced secrets). `writeBackupTar` treats an unreadable blob or malformed ref as fatal (enumerate already proved existence; remove-on-error still cleans the partial archive). `MissingBlobs` removed from `fullBackupResult`; key material deliberately still stages from the live store (append-mostly custody data; snapshot purity applies to blob refs). `--json` stdout remains a single document (P7-CLI-01).
- Tests: `TestAllBlobRefsInFile` (post-snapshot live binding absent from the snapshot's refs), `TestFullBackupMissingBlobFatal` (error names the ref; no archive, no stray staging dirs), `TestFullBackupRetriesOnDrift` (attempt-1 drift heals by attempt 2; hook sees ≥2 attempts), `TestFullBackupJSONWarningsInPayload` repointed at the config-warning path; new e2e `db_full_backup_missing_blob.txtar` (rm ciphertext → nonzero exit, stderr names the class, no archive).
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` + `spec/12_DATA_MODEL_SQLITE.md`: snapshot-enumeration + fatal-missing-blob contract documented.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-DATA-03` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 counts re-derived from the table at merge (serial wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

- `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` (0 issues)
- Implementer: grok-4.5 from a written line-level spec; coordinator line-by-line review (one fix applied: the unreadable-blob tar error now wraps the underlying error instead of always claiming "missing on disk").
- Post-review (Codex): accepted-with-residual — the referenced ciphertext files are not frozen between the retry loop's final stat pass and the tar write, so a rotation landing in that window still fails the backup. Deliberate: the failure is LOUD (hard error, partial archive removed), never a silent omission; re-running the backup is the remedy. Documented at writeBackupTar.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(hub): fsLock owner identity + nonce-verified break/release (P7-QUAL-07)

Changed:
- `internal/hub/folder.go`: the shared carrier lock (`fsLock`, used by both the git and folder carriers) now writes an immutable JSON owner record at O_EXCL create — `{version, pid, hostname, nonce (16B crypto/rand hex), acquired_at, started_at}` — instead of a bare PID it never read back. Staleness is owner-aware: same-host owners are judged by process liveness paired with the opaque `platform.ProcessStartTime` identity (P7-GIT-03 semantics — a live PID with a different start identity is a recycled PID, broken immediately; a genuinely live holder is NEVER broken regardless of mtime, so suspend/sleep past the TTL now times out the second acquirer with an owner-naming error instead of stealing the checkout); legacy bare-PID, corrupt, and cross-host records age out on the mtime TTL exactly as before (the upgrade path — a corrupt lock must read as breakable-after-TTL, never held-forever). Stale break double-reads the owner bytes and removes only when unchanged (unreadable files additionally require stable identity/size/mtime); release removes only its own nonce generation, killing the break-then-release cascade theft; the heartbeat goroutine stops when the lock file disappears rather than resurrecting a successor's mtime.
- `internal/hub/fslock_test.go` (new): owner roundtrip, timeout-names-owner, legacy bare-PID fresh/backdated, corrupt-JSON fresh/backdated, dead-PID immediate break, recycled-PID (live PID + mismatched start identity) immediate break, live-PID-never-stale (backdated mtime), release-after-broken leaves the successor, and break double-read race — all under `-race`.
- `internal/hub/gitcarrier.go`: lock-semantics comment updated (constants and construction unchanged).
- `spec/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` (folder-carrier fsLock sentence) + `spec/15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md` (git- and folder-carrier lock paragraphs): owner-aware staleness, recycled-PID identity, nonce-verified break/release, and the bounded verify-then-remove residual (no portable compare-and-delete) documented; the mtime-only stale-break residual retired.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-QUAL-07` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 open/P2 counts re-derived from the table at merge time (multi-PR wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/hub/ -count=1 -race`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- Implementer: Codex (gpt-5.6) from a written line-level spec; coordinator line-by-line review added the `ProcessStartTime` recycled-PID identity (review finding: a crashed holder whose PID was recycled to a long-lived process would otherwise wedge the lock forever, since the same-host live path ignores mtime).

- Post-review (opus, dual-review): MERGE-READY verdict; two accepted residuals sharpened in spec/15 with concrete scenarios — (pre-existing, narrowed) two independent breakers that both verified the same stale record can interleave so the slower path-based `Remove` deletes the faster one's fresh lock (candidate close: flock-serialized decide+remove on a sibling breaker file — valid because the lock lives on the local filesystem); and a false-"alive" same-host owner (Linux boot-relative tick collision after reboot, identity 0 on unsupported platforms) wedges the lock until that process exits, deliberately without an mtime backstop (any TTL override would reintroduce the suspended-holder steal). Two review-suggested tests added: `TestFSLockHeartbeatStopsWhenLockVanishes`, `TestFSLockEmptyFileUsesTTLPath`.

- Post-review (CodeRabbit, round 2): (Major fixed) the owner record is now STAGED in full and link-published atomically (`stageOwnerRecord` + `os.Link`, EEXIST = contention), replacing the O_EXCL create-then-write shape whose empty-file window could age into a TTL break stealing a suspended creator's lock; pinned by `TestFSLockPublishedRecordIsAlwaysComplete` (concurrent reader never observes an empty/torn record across 50 acquire/release cycles) alongside the earlier `TestFSLockPartialOwnerRecordUsesTTLPath` (incomplete records fall to the TTL, never the dead-PID-0 path, via `validFSLockOwner`). (Minor fixed) the ledger row and spec/15 now qualify immediate recycled-PID detection on a usable, resolvable process identity.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(hub): os.Root-confined carrier file access (P7-SEC-04)

Changed:
- `internal/hub/gitcarrier.go` + `internal/hub/folder.go`: the fsObjectStore's check-then-use `safePath` (Lstat-walk, then open by path) is replaced by per-operation `os.Root` handles — every object read/write/stat/list/delete, the timestamp sidecars, and the atomic temp+fsync+rename writes (`writeRootFileAtomic`) now resolve through the Root's per-component O_NOFOLLOW + symlink-target recheck, so a component swapped for a symlink between check and open can no longer redirect I/O outside the carrier root. Key validation (empty/absolute/backslash/dot-segment refusal) is retained. The folder carrier pins root identity: `openRoot` compares the fresh handle's `Stat(".")` against the construction-time directory (`os.SameFile`), closing the residual swap window between `revalidateRoot` and `OpenRoot`; the git carrier's marker read also rides a Root handle. Private cache sidecars (`head.json`, `observed.json`) stay on plain os access by design (outside the store root).
- Tests: post-construction intermediate-component symlink-swap refusal (read AND write, no escaped file) for both carriers; existing hub suites (incl. the P7-HUB-02 continuity set) green under `-race`.
- `spec/15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`: the folder-carrier check-then-use residual is retired; confinement is now enforced at the file API by `os.Root` (Go 1.26 stdlib).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-SEC-04` moved open → *Recently shipped*; counts re-derived at merge (serial wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/hub/ -count=1 -race`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./cmd/devstrap -run 'TestScript/sync_folder_hub|TestScript/sync_git_hub|TestScript/hub_' -count=1`.
- Implementer: Codex (gpt-5.6) from a written spec (fix chosen per exa research: Go 1.24+ `os.Root` per-component O_NOFOLLOW; repo is on 1.26.5); coordinator line-by-line review.
- Post-review (opus, dual-review): MERGE-READY; one consistency hardening applied — `writeMarkerLocked` now writes through the same `os.Root` handle (Lstat + O_EXCL create) instead of path-based `os.Stat`/`os.WriteFile`, so the marker write's confinement is structural rather than dependent on `validateMarkerLocked` having run first.

Follow-ups:
- Optional hardening: flock-serialize the fsLock breaker section (closes the two-breaker interleave, spec/15 residual).

- None.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(state): migration 00023 rollback fails closed on populated env LWW coordinates (P7-DATA-07)

Changed:
- `internal/state/store.go` `Store.Down`: before rolling back FROM schema version 23, counts `env_profiles` rows with any non-NULL `source_event_hlc`/`source_event_device_id`/`source_event_id` and refuses the rollback when populated — dropping those columns would erase the cross-device env LWW incumbent (`envCoordLess` treats absent coordinates as "no winner", so a delayed older event would overwrite a newer value after down→up). The error tells the operator to `devstrap db backup --full` and clear the coordinates explicitly first. Guard placement in `Store.Down` (not a Go migration) keeps the embedded SQL-only goose setup intact and covers both `devstrap db down` and direct state-layer callers; the up path and every other down step (incl. 24→23) are unaffected. Migration 00023's SQL is unchanged.
- `internal/state/store_test.go`: `TestMigration00023DownRefusesPopulatedCoordinates` (populated → refused, version stays 23, columns and values intact) and `TestMigration00023DownEmptyCoordinatesSucceeds` (all-NULL → down to 22, columns dropped, re-migrate restores them), plus an `envProfilesHasColumn` PRAGMA helper. Schema-version constants stay at 24.
- `spec/12_DATA_MODEL_SQLITE.md` (migrations) + `spec/07_NAMESPACE_AND_SYNC_MODEL.md` (env LWW): rollback-protection documented.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-DATA-07` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 counts re-derived from the table at merge time (serial wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state/ ./internal/cli/ -count=1`
- Implementer: Codex (gpt-5.6) from a written line-level spec, after two grok-4.5 attempts died mid-run without writing (model-picker escalation); coordinator line-by-line review.
- Post-review (Codex): accepted-with-residual — the populated check and `goose.Down` run in separate transactions (goose owns its own), so a concurrent process writing a coordinate inside that gap can still lose it; documented at the guard, and the P7-DATA-05 maintenance state lock (which `db down` will also take) is the closing mechanism.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(sync): deterministic draft-snapshot latest/prune tiebreak (P7-SYNC-03)

Changed:
- `internal/state/store.go`: `LatestDraftSnapshot`'s `ORDER BY`, `PruneDraftSnapshots`' window-function `ORDER BY`, and `RetainedBlobRefs`' window-function `ORDER BY` all changed from `COALESCE(source_event_hlc, 0) DESC, created_at DESC, id DESC` to `COALESCE(source_event_hlc, 0) DESC, COALESCE(source_event_device_id, '') DESC, COALESCE(source_event_id, '') DESC` — the canonical `(hlc, source_event_device_id, source_event_id)` fleet tiebreak already used by `samePathLess`/`envCoordLess` (`internal/sync/events.go`). `created_at` (local wall clock) and `id` (a locally-minted `snap_<uuidv7>`) both differ per device for the same source event, so on an HLC tie two devices could pick different "latest" snapshots to materialize, keep different snapshots after prune GC, or (via `RetainedBlobRefs`, which backs `hub gc --dry-run`) preview a different blob as retained than the real prune run actually keeps. `RetainedBlobRefs` was a Codex post-implementation review catch (the same anti-pattern, backing `hub gc --dry-run`, missed by the initial fix). All three functions' doc comments note the shared coordinate.
- `internal/state/store_test.go`: `TestLatestDraftSnapshotDeterministicTiebreak`, `TestPruneDraftSnapshotsDeterministicTiebreak`, and `TestRetainedBlobRefsDeterministicTiebreakMatchesPrune` — each inserts the canonical winner (higher `(device_id, event_id)`) first via `RecordDraftSnapshot`, then the loser, then force-sets the winner's `created_at` earlier than the loser's so the OLD ordering demonstrably prefers the loser (verified by manually reverting each fix in turn and confirming its test fails); the prune and retained-refs tests additionally assert prune and the dry-run preview agree on the same surviving blob.
- `spec/07_NAMESPACE_AND_SYNC_MODEL.md`: the materialize `draft_project` bullet and the draft restore steps now state that "newest" means the highest `(hlc, source_event_device_id, source_event_id)` coordinate, not local `created_at`/`id`.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-SYNC-03` moved open → *Recently shipped*; Pass-7 open 36→35, P3 19→18.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state/ -run 'TestLatestDraftSnapshot|TestPruneDraftSnapshots|TestRetainedBlobRefs' -count=1` (all three new tests pass; each is constructed so the old `created_at DESC, id DESC` ordering demonstrably prefers the loser)

Follow-ups:
- None.

- Take the P7-DATA-05 maintenance state lock in `db down` when it lands, closing the check→Down cross-process window.
## 2026-07-11 — fix(hub): refuse rewound or deleted git-carrier history (P7-HUB-02)

Changed:
- `internal/hub/gitcarrier.go`: added the atomic cache-side `head.json` last-known-good head record with retention hash/ProducedAt/floors; every accepted fetch and successful push records it, and compaction records its squashed head after the force-push. Fetch now accepts same-head and descendant updates, admits a non-descendant only when the checked-out retention manifest strictly advances, refuses branch deletion after first contact, and fails closed on corrupt continuity state with the exact cache-removal recovery path. Retention is read directly through the inner `R2Hub` while the carrier mutex is held; signature authenticity remains the sync layer's responsibility.
- `internal/git/git.go`: `CommandError` now retains/exposes the subprocess exit status so the continuity check distinguishes `git merge-base --is-ancestor` exit 1 from operational failures instead of treating every error as a non-ancestor.
- Tests: new real-bare-remote continuity coverage for branch deletion, same/second-device rewind refusal, explicit cache-removal recovery, compacting-device and observer-device legitimate compaction, old-manifest parentless replacement refusal, first-write TOFU/head creation, corrupt `head.json`, and pushed-head equality. The pre-existing compaction test now mirrors production order by publishing retention before squashing.
- Docs/spec: architecture, sync-model, threat-model, self-hosting recovery guidance, and the Pass-7 audit ledger document the guard, its complement to signed retention monotonicity, and the dumb-carrier availability residual; `P7-HUB-02` moved to Recently shipped (Pass-7 counts re-derived from the open table at merge — serial wave).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w internal/git internal/hub`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/git ./internal/hub`
- Full required gate results recorded at handoff.

- Review pass (Grok, 2 Majors fixed): the strict-advance rule falsely refused legitimate compaction for any device that observed the advanced PRE-squash retention tip (production compact PutRetentions on a normal commit, then squashes reusing the SAME manifest bytes) and wedged a compactor that crashed before persisting the squashed head. Acceptance now also passes a byte-identical manifest fingerprint, and a new content gate (when the prior head is in the odb) refuses any rewrite deleting an event object at or above the new floors — closing the same-manifest data-dropping rewrite the fingerprint alone cannot distinguish. An unparsed recorded fingerprint only accepts identical bytes; `fetchedSHA` now updates after compaction. New tests: observer-of-advanced-tip accepts squash, crash-before-head-save compactor self-heals, floor-regression refused, no-retention parentless refused, event-dropping parentless refused.

- Post-review (coordinator + CodeRabbit): the `gitHeadState` comment and the self-hosting recovery section now state the byte-identical-fingerprint acceptance alongside strict advance (they contradicted the implementation); the recovery section additionally states that cache-removal re-adoption does not re-upload history (push watermarks are untouched, so events a rewind erased are not re-sent) and recommends `devstrap hub compact` from an up-to-date device after knowingly accepting a lossy carrier, so the sealed snapshot covers pre-rewind state for later bootstraps.

Follow-ups:
- Repair ergonomics (optional): a `devstrap sync --accept-rewritten-carrier` that re-adopts AND resets the hub push/pull cursors (re-push is idempotent via conditional-put dedup) would automate lossy-accept repair instead of relying on the compact/snapshot path.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(git): guard repo locks and agent-run sweeps against PID reuse (P7-GIT-03)

Changed:
- Added build-tagged `platform.ProcessStartTime`: raw `/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22 on Linux (robust to spaces/parentheses in `comm`), `kern.proc.pid` start time in microseconds on macOS, and `errors.ErrUnsupported` elsewhere. Values remain opaque same-host/same-boot equality identities.
- Repo locks now record `started_at`; same-host stale detection requires both PID liveness and matching process identity, while missing identities and lookup errors retain the conservative legacy behavior. Agent runs record the same identity through migration `00024`, and the crash sweep interrupts a run when its live PID belongs to a different process.
- Threaded `runner_started_at` through every `agent_runs` insert/select/scan, bumped schema expectations to 24, and added matching/mismatching/lookup-error lock coverage plus matching/mismatching live-PID sweep coverage and platform round-trip tests.
- Updated specs 08/10/12/13/15 and the audit ledger; Pass 7 open arithmetic moves 41→40 and P2 22→21.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state/ ./internal/cli/ ./internal/platform/`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- `GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE=/tmp/devstrap-golangci-cache-pr5 go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` (0 issues).
- Cross-compiled `internal/platform` tests for Darwin (`GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -c`) to verify the sysctl adapter shape.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(git): make `worktree cleanup` safe (P7-GIT-01, P7-GIT-02, P7-CLI-02)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/worktree.go`: `worktree cleanup` gains `Args: usageArgs(cobra.NoArgs)` so a stray positional cannot silently discard into a fleet-wide sweep (P7-CLI-02). Before the loop, `sweepStaleAgentRuns` reconciles dead-PID running rows. Path-present reaps move into `cleanupOneWorktree`, which refuses any still-running `agent_runs` row for the worktree (including no PID), holds `acquireRepoLock` across dirty-check → base-refresh → merge checks → dirty TOCTOU re-check → `WorktreeRemove` → `branch -D` → `MarkWorktreeRemoved`, and skips (warn) on repo lock conflict rather than failing the whole sweep. Path-missing prune stays outside the lock. the lock-taking `refreshWorktreeBase` wrapper had no remaining callers and was removed; cleanup uses the new `refreshWorktreeBaseLocked` (fetch only) under its held lock.
- `internal/state/store.go`: `RunningAgentRunsByWorktree` — same SELECT/scan shape as `RunningAgentRunsWithPID`, filter `status='running' AND worktree_id=?` (no PID requirement).
- Tests: store `TestRunningAgentRunsByWorktree`; CLI `TestWorktreeCleanupSkipsRunningAgentRunThenReapsAfterFinish` (live PID blocks, succeeded status reaps), `TestWorktreeCleanupRejectsPositionalArgs`; dirty re-check documented as lock-scoped (no DirtyState seam).
- Specs: `spec/08`, `spec/10`, `spec/13` document NoArgs + agent-run skip + lock + dirty re-check; ledger moves the three P2s to *Recently shipped* (Pass-7 open 40→37, P2 21→18).
- Review pass (Codex, 2 Majors fixed): the running-run check moved UNDER cleanup's repo lock, and `agent run` now holds the same lock from worktree creation through `InsertAgentRun` (new `createFreshWorktreeLocked`; orphan cleanup on policy/id/insert failure) — closing the startup window where a fresh agent worktree existed without its running row; the path-missing prune + `MarkWorktreeRemoved` also moved under the lock (metadata prune raced `worktree new` on `.git/worktrees`).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli/ ./internal/state/`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

Follow-ups:
- None for these three findings. `P7-GIT-03` (PID-reuse guard on `processAlive`) remains open and is adjacent but distinct.

## 2026-07-11 — fix(cli): `db backup --full --json` / `db restore --json` emit a single clean JSON document (P7-CLI-01)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/db_backup.go`: `fullBackupResult` gains `Warnings []string`; the three pre-render `Fprintf(stdout, "warning: …")` sites in `runFullBackup` (missing blobs, no keys, no config) append to `result.Warnings` instead. Human render prints each as `warning: <msg>` before the summary line. `runRestore` uses a typed `restoreResult{Restored, Items, Warnings}`; `warnKeychainCustodyRestore` becomes `keychainCustodyRestoreWarning` returning `""` or the two-line custody message, appended to `result.Warnings` when non-empty. Nothing writes to stdout outside the render callback under `--json`.
- Tests: `TestFullBackupJSONWarningsInPayload` (deleted blob → full stdout unmarshals; `warnings` mentions missing blobs); `TestRestoreJSONIsSingleDocument` (fresh-home restore `--json` is one document with `restored`/`items`, no raw `warning:` text).
- Review pass (Codex): human output keeps the original one-ref-per-indented-line missing-blob list (the summary warning is appended last so the refs print directly beneath it; JSON carries refs structured in `missing_blobs`); `TestRestoreJSONCarriesKeychainCustodyWarning` pins the custody guidance riding the payload's `warnings` array.
- Docs: `spec/13` notes `--json` carries warnings in the payload `warnings` array (`last_reviewed` 2026-07-11); ledger moves `P7-CLI-01` open → *Recently shipped* (Pass-7 open 41→40, P2 22→21).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli/ -run 'Backup|Restore' -count=1`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli/`

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-10 — fix(sync): every device that learns of a revoke owes the WCK rotation (P7-SYNC-04)

Changed:
- `internal/state/wck_rotation.go` (new): the `wck_rotation_pending` marker format (`WCKRotationPendingMetaKey` / `WCKRotationPendingRecord`) moves here from `internal/cli` so `internal/sync` can arm it transactionally without importing `internal/cli` (layering). New Tx helpers: `CurrentKeyEpochTx` (transactional form of `CurrentKeyEpoch`) and `SetWCKRotationPendingTx(epoch)` — arms the owed-rotation marker, `epoch<=0` is a no-op (keyless device holds no key to protect and its rotation gate skips epoch 0, which would strand the marker), and an existing marker is left untouched (storm-guard: preserves the original "owed since" so a later flip cannot reset the clock and replays/re-imports are inert; a malformed existing marker stays pending, matching the cli reader's fail-closed treatment).
- `internal/cli/wck_rotation.go`: `wckRotationPendingMetaKey`/`wckRotationPendingRecord` become aliases of the `internal/state` exports (single source of truth); the revoke-path `markWCKRotationPending`/`wckRotationPendingSince`/`clearWCKRotationPending` helpers and the `sync` rotation gate / `doctor` are unchanged, so a marker armed by the sync apply path is consumed by the existing gate.
- `internal/sync/events.go`: the `EventDeviceRevoked`/`EventDeviceLost` apply, on an actual flip, reads `CurrentKeyEpochTx` and calls `SetWCKRotationPendingTx` in the same transaction as the flip. A device that only LEARNS of a revoke — not just the revoker — now owes the forward-secrecy rotation, so the fleet stops sealing under an epoch the revoked device holds even if the revoker's own rotation failed and it went offline.
- `internal/sync/snapshot_import.go`: `importTrustTx` does the same on `changedAny`, so a device that learns of a revocation via snapshot bootstrap (the `P7-SYNC-01` recovery path) also owes the rotation; the stale "not set here — tracked as P7-SYNC-04" comment is replaced.
- Tests: `internal/state/wck_rotation_test.go` (helper unit tests: arms at epoch>0, epoch-0 no-op, storm-guard preserves the original record, `CurrentKeyEpochTx` matches `CurrentKeyEpoch`); `internal/sync/wck_rotation_owed_test.go` (remote `device.revoked`/`device.lost` apply arms the marker at the active epoch; snapshot-import flip arms it; keyless epoch-0 device flips trust but never arms; storm-guard — replay never touches the marker and a later distinct flip preserves the original Since); `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/sync_never_granted_epoch_wedge.txtar` updated — B now rotates to epoch 3 on learning of D's revoke, so it grants 3 (not 2) held epochs on re-approving C (the P7-SYNC-04 fix observed end-to-end).
- Docs: `spec/07` TRUST-01 apply + revoke/lost rotation bullet gain the P7-SYNC-04 fleet extension and the accepted "each learner rotates once" residual; `spec/15` §"revoked device keeps pushing" threat gains the same; ledger row moved to *Recently shipped* (Pass-7 open 42→41, P3 20→19).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `golangci-lint run` (0 issues)
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...` (all green, incl. the updated txtar)

Follow-ups:
- None. Accepted residual (documented spec/07/15): each device that learns of a revoke rotates once — a newer epoch is not proof of exclusion (a peer that has not pulled the revoke can regrant it), so the containment is intentionally per-learner; bounded (grants never arm the marker), terminating, forward-secure.

## 2026-07-10 — fix(sync): carry terminal device-trust in snapshot.v2 (P7-SYNC-01, the Pass-7 P1)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/snapshot.go`: `snapshotVersion` 1→2; new `Trust []SnapshotTrust{DeviceID, State}` on the snapshot document (revoked/lost only, State-only — no source-event coordinates: the revoke event may already be compacted away on the builder, and `ApplyRemoteDeviceTrustTx` is sticky/monotonic with no HLC compare, so State-only import is exactly equivalent to replay; `P7-SYNC-02`'s future `revoked_at_hlc` becomes an additive `omitempty` field). Envelope/document version checks stay exact-equality fail-closed (old binaries refuse v2; this binary refuses trust-less v1 snapshots); retention-manifest READS accept `{1,2}` via `retentionManifestVersionOK` (floors are trust-neutral, and the first upgraded compactor must reconcile the pre-existing v1 manifest before it can publish v2 — a pure bump would wedge its own remedy) while `SignRetentionManifest` stamps 2. The helper is the seam where `P7-PROD-03`'s min-reader range lands.
- `internal/state/snapshot_reads.go`: `SnapshotTrustRow` + `Store.SnapshotTrust` (revoked/lost rows, deterministic id order).
- `internal/sync/snapshot_build.go`: fifth store read populates `snap.Trust`.
- `internal/sync/snapshot_import.go`: `importTrustTx` inside the existing single import transaction, mirroring the `EventDeviceRevoked`/`EventDeviceLost` apply exactly (`EnsureRemoteDeviceTx` → `ApplyRemoteDeviceTrustTx`; `MarkEncryptedBindingsNeedingRotationTx` once on an actual flip; never flips local; re-import no-op; malformed row aborts the WHOLE import fail-closed). The `wck_rotation_pending` marker is deliberately NOT set here — the same asymmetry exists on the events apply path and is tracked as `P7-SYNC-04`.
- `internal/cli/snapshot_recovery.go`: envelope-parse failures now name the remedy (run `hub compact` from an upgraded device).
- Tests: `internal/sync/snapshot_trust_test.go` (build carries terminal trust only; import flips approved→revoked/pending→lost + flags rotation; re-import no-re-flag; own-device never flips; unknown target → revoked placeholder; malformed row aborts atomically; trust import≡replay pin; version fail-closed matrix incl. hand-sealed v1 document; retention-manifest v1-accept/v3-refuse); `testSnapshot()` round-trips a trust row; e2e `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/hub_compact_trust_recovery.txtar` pins the full P1 scenario — A/B/C converge, C offline, A revokes B (epoch 2) and compacts (revoke event AND C's epoch-2 grant deleted below the floor), C returns → keyless defer (fail-closed), operator re-approves C (grants land above the floor), C snapshot-recovers → **B lands revoked on C with rotation flagged**, and revoked B's own sync stays locked out at the snapshot gate.
- Docs: `spec/07` snapshot-object inventory rewritten for v2 (trust rows, both-ways fail-closed versioning, manifest read-compat) and the TRUST-01 "whole fleet learns the decision"/"fleet-wide" claims qualified (pre-fix they held only for devices online across the revoke-to-compaction window); `spec/15` P6-SYNC-01 threat section gains the compaction-survival note + the accepted stale-snapshot-re-flip residual; ledger row moved to *Recently shipped* (Pass-7 open 47→46, P1 1→0).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean)
- `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...` (incl. the untouched `import_replay_property_test.go` import≡replay property and the new txtar)

Follow-ups:
- `P7-SYNC-04`: remote/snapshot trust flips should make the RECEIVER owe a WCK rotation (`wck_rotation_pending`) — next PR in this wave.
- Observed while building the e2e (pre-existing, distinct from P7-SYNC-01): a device offline across a revoke-triggered rotation ALSO misses its new-epoch grant, and compaction deletes that grant, so it defers keyless until an operator re-approves it (`devices approve` re-grants held epochs above the floor). Fail-closed and recoverable, but nothing re-emits grants automatically and `doctor` on the stuck device cannot name the cause — worth a finding in the next audit pass.
## 2026-07-10 — fix(hub): atomic temp+fsync+rename writes for mutable carrier objects (P7-HUB-05)

Changed:
- `internal/hub/gitcarrier.go`: added `writeFileAtomic` (same-dir `os.CreateTemp(".tmp-*")`, chmod 0600, write, `fsync`, close, `os.Rename`; temp removed on error). Wired into `fsObjectStore.PutObject` and `PutObjectIfMatch` (the folder-carrier exposure for torn `retention.json` / `sweep.lock`). Also wired `writeTimestamp` sidecars — they live in the shared folder for the folder carrier. Left alone: git carrier marker (`writeMarkerLocked`, private clone, shielded by `reset --hard`) and `observed.json` (`saveObsLocked`, machine-local under the private cache, never in the shared folder). `listKeys` ignores orphan `.tmp-*` basenames.
- `internal/hub/folder_test.go`: success/no-residue, rename-failure cleanup, `PutObject`/`PutObjectIfMatch` full-body reads, and listKeys ignore of planted `.tmp-` orphans.
- `spec/15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`: folder-carrier residual notes atomic write + documented cloud-drive mid-replication window (`P7-HUB-05`).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P7-HUB-05` moved open → Recently shipped; Pass 7 open count decremented.
## 2026-07-10 — fix(devices): transactional revoke-containment marker + sync resume (P7-SEC-02)

Changed:
- `internal/state/store.go` adds transaction-level `local_meta` read/write/delete helpers with SQL matching the existing store-level operations. `devices revoke`/`lost` now merges the target into the machine-local JSON `revoke_containment_pending` set in the same transaction as the trust flip and synced trust event.
- The post-revoke path clears only that target after rotation either succeeds or is durably handed to `wck_rotation_pending`, secret bindings are flagged, and blob rewrap completes. `sync` resumes every pending target after pull, rotates at most once per cycle, performs the remaining containment work, best-effort deletes stale acks, and clears only successfully-contained devices. Malformed marker JSON stays pending fail-closed.
- `doctor` reports pending device IDs and since-times with the sync remedy. Regression coverage pins transactional marking, the former `CurrentEpoch` zero-record window, happy-path clearing, sync resume, doctor output, and two-revoke merge preservation. `spec/15` and the Pass-7 ledger record the shipped mitigation.
- Post-review (fable-5 line-by-line, two applied): (1) a CORRUPT existing pending record no longer aborts the trust-flip transaction — refusing a revoke over retry bookkeeping would keep a compromised device approved, the exact wrong fail direction; the mark path overwrites with a fresh record (the resume actions are device-independent global scans, so the only loss is the best-effort per-device ack deletion, which `hub compact` reclaims anyway), pinned by `TestRevokeContainmentCorruptMarkerNeverBlocksRevoke`; (2) the resume path's bindings-flag failure now warns instead of returning silently (marker stays pending either way).
- Post-review (CodeRabbit Major, applied): a MALFORMED containment marker previously kept `containmentPending=true` forever, so the rotation gate fired `Rotate()` on every sync (a storm) while `resumeRevokeContainment` only warned; now, once rotation is accounted, resume runs the device-independent containment (bindings flag + rewrap) and DELETES the whole malformed row (per-device ack cleanup, which needs the device set, defers to `hub compact`). Read side stays fail-closed (a corrupt marker never reads as "nothing pending"); the clear happens only after containment is proven done. Pinned by `TestSyncClearsMalformedContainmentMarker`.
- Post-review (independent Codex): fixed the sole P3 finding — a containment-only sync resume now derives its rotation message from the earliest transactional device timestamp instead of printing the zero year when no `wck_rotation_pending` row exists; the sync regression test rejects year-0001 output. Narrow re-review found no remaining issue.

Validated:

- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./internal/hub/...`
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./internal/hub/... ./internal/cli/...`

- Post-review (Codex gpt-5.6, two MINORs, both applied; plus one unsolicited worker edit kept after review): (1) `listKeys` now RECLAIMS `.tmp-*` crash orphans once safely stale (`staleTempAge` = 1h — a same-machine writer finishes in seconds and another device's in-flight cloud-drive upload carries a fresh mtime), instead of skipping them forever; best-effort remove, retried on the next list. (2) `TestFsObjectStoreConcurrentOverwriteNeverTearsReads` pins the rename guarantee the write-then-read tests could not (an in-place `os.WriteFile` would have passed those): concurrent readers of a large object flipping between two generations always observe one FULL generation. Plus `TestListKeysReclaimsStaleTempOrphans` (stale reclaimed, fresh retained). (3) `writeFileAtomic` also fsyncs the parent DIRECTORY after the rename (best-effort — not all filesystems support it) so the directory-entry update survives a power loss; without it a crash immediately after return could revert to the prior (still-complete, never torn) generation. This slice arrived as an unsolicited late edit from the implementing agent after sign-off; it was reviewed line-by-line, judged sound, gosec-annotated, and kept.

Follow-ups:
- None for this finding; residual cloud-drive mid-replication window stays accepted (spec/15).

## 2026-07-10 — fix(sandbox): deny-list gains .git-credentials, .config/gcloud, .azure (P7-SEC-01)

Changed:
- `internal/platform/sandbox_profile.go`: `sensitiveHomeDirs` gains `.config/gcloud` and `.azure`; `sensitiveHomeFiles` gains `.git-credentials`. These two lists are the SINGLE source for the macOS Seatbelt deny profile, the bubblewrap masks, `credentialAnchors`, and `readConfineRoots`, so all backends and the read-confine conflict guard inherit the additions. Under the default `guarded` policy (allow-default reads) a compromised child could otherwise read git's plaintext HTTPS-token store and the GCP/Azure CLI token dirs by absolute path.
- `internal/cli/agent.go`: the wrapper-level file-path `denyParts` gains `/.config/gcloud`, `/.azure`, `/.git-credentials` for parity with the OS deny set.
- Tests: `TestBwrapSensitivePathsCoversCloudAndGitCredentials` and `TestCredentialAnchorsCoverCloudAndGitCredentials` explicitly pin the three new paths (the existing list-derived assertions would silently pass a regression that dropped them).
- Docs: `spec/10` credential-deny enumeration + AGEN-05 deny-list note; `spec/15` SECU-02 reachability note; both `last_reviewed` bumped. Ledger row moved to *Recently shipped*.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./internal/platform/... ./internal/cli/...`
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./internal/platform/...`

- Post-review (CodeRabbit, two Major applied): (1) parity — the wrapper-level `agentPathLooksSensitive`/`agentTokenLooksSensitive` now also flag `.gitconfig` and `.git-credentials` (the OS sandbox masked them but the coarse wrapper policy waved them through), pinned by `TestAgentSensitiveParityWithSandboxDenyList`; (2) the SECU-02 spec claim is scoped — HOME-repoint is environment isolation only (blocks relative lookups, NOT absolute-path reads); absolute credential reads are denied by the OS deny-list only on full-fidelity backends (Seatbelt/bubblewrap), while the Landlock fallback keeps credential paths readable unless `--read-confine` is on.

Follow-ups:
- `P7-SEC-03` (separate finding): under `--sandbox require` the Landlock fallback still cannot subtract the standalone credential deny — auto-engaging read-confine there subsumes these paths.
## 2026-07-10 — chore(release): gate macOS notarization on all five MACOS_* secrets (0-or-5) + Gatekeeper verification (P7-QUAL-03)

Changed:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: added a pre-GoReleaser 0-or-5 validation step for `MACOS_SIGN_P12`, `MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD`, `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY`, `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID`, and `MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`. Partial configuration fails early and reports exactly the set/missing names without printing values; the dormant `isEnvSet "MACOS_SIGN_P12"` activation remains unchanged.
- `.goreleaser.yaml`, `RELEASING.md`, and `spec/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`: documented the all-five-at-once contract. Since the release publisher runs on Ubuntu, `spctl` cannot run in-job; the enrollment checklist now requires downloading and extracting a darwin artifact on a Mac and passing `spctl --assess --type execute` before promotion or cask update.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: moved `P7-QUAL-03` from the Pass 7 open table to *Recently shipped* and reconciled the open counts.

Validated:
- `go run github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@latest check`
- `python3 -c "import yaml,sys; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/release.yml'))"`
- `bash -n` over the extracted 0-or-5 validation step (shell syntax of the array/`[[ ]]` gate)
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `gofmt -w cmd internal` (no Go source changes)
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./cmd/... ./internal/cli/...`

Follow-ups:
- Full signing, notarization, and Gatekeeper runtime verification is impossible until the next tag. On that release, complete the required manual macOS `spctl` smoke step before promotion or Homebrew cask update.

## 2026-07-10 — chore(deps): bump golang.org/x/crypto v0.52.0, golang.org/x/net v0.55.0

Changed:
- `go.mod`/`go.sum`: `golang.org/x/crypto` v0.51.0→v0.52.0, `golang.org/x/net` v0.54.0→v0.55.0. Supersedes Dependabot #143/#126, which cannot pass the spec-drift gate (go.mod changes require a spec touch); rewritten as one manual PR per the gate's contract.
- `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md`: dated history note on the dependency bump.

Validated:

## 2026-07-10 — docs(product): commercialization spec, website plan, README rewrite, AGENTS tightening

Changed:
- `spec/20_COMMERCIALIZATION_AND_PRICING.md` (new): the plan for a managed-hub commercial tier alongside the free OSS BYO-hub product — open-core boundary (CLI + self-hosting free forever), a 10-product comparable-pricing table (Tailscale/Ngrok/Docker/Doppler/Infisical/1Password/Raycast/Codespaces/Ona/Coder, researched 2026-07-10), an R2 cost model (hub operations are ~$0.001/device/month; storage dominates → meter storage + device count, not operations), recommended packaging (generous free tier, ~$8 Individual, flat-then-scale Team, custom Enterprise), and the engineering prerequisites drawn from the Pass-7 `P7-PROD-*` findings (control plane, credential broker, server-side quotas, version-skew policy).
- `spec/21_WEBSITE_PLAN.md` (new): the marketing + docs site — two conversion paths (OSS install + hosted-tier waitlist), IA, a tech-stack recommendation (Astro + Starlight + Tailwind on Cloudflare Pages, with Next.js/Vercel weighed and deferred to a future dashboard), terminal-first design with a VHS hero demo, single-sourced docs from the repo's `docs/` tier, `devstrap.dev` as the recommended domain (skip the $4,150 parked `.com` for now), and a phased launch checklist.
- `README.md`: reconciled to shipped reality (the OS sandbox and `devstrap service` were described as unbuilt — `P7-DOC-01`); status now names the `v0.1.1` supply-chain-verified release, the command reference adds `service`/`keys` and `db restore`, the roadmap and near-term-priorities reflect the closed multi-device wave, the latest-audit pointer is Pass 7, and a truthful managed-tier forward-pointer to `spec/20` was added (the CLI + self-hosting stay free/OSS forever).
- `AGENTS.md`: tightened (55→~44 lines) — compressed the Live-R2 dogfood section without losing the "source the `0600` file each shell, never paste secrets" contract; PR-cycle invariants unchanged.
- `spec/00_START_HERE.md`: document-map entries for `20`/`21`; `last_reviewed` bumped.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean — doc-only cycle)
- `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (`TestEveryCommandIsDocumented` confirms every command in the README/spec/00 inventories exists)
- README command claims cross-checked against `devstrap --help`.

Follow-ups:
- `spec/20` price points are a hypothesis to validate against real waitlist demand; the managed tier is unshippable until the `P7-PROD-04` control plane exists.
- The website ships from a separate `devstrap-web` repo (per `spec/21`) to keep the spec-drift gate off site PRs.

## 2026-07-10 — chore(ci): bump Go to 1.26.5 (clear GO-2026-5856); refresh CLAUDE.md

Changed:
- `go.mod`: `go 1.26.4` → `go 1.26.5`. All CI/release jobs resolve the toolchain via `go-version-file: go.mod`, so this one line moves every job to 1.26.5, which fixes `GO-2026-5856` (a `crypto/tls` standard-library vulnerability) that was failing the required `vuln` govulncheck gate on every branch, `main` included — a pre-existing blocker unrelated to any feature change.
- `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md`: noted the Go-pin mechanism + this bump in the govulncheck-gate history; `last_reviewed` bumped.
- `CLAUDE.md`: refreshed the maintainer's model-picker/preferences (grok-4.5 added, gpt-5.5 → gpt-5.6, new Tech Stack / Code Style / General Preferences sections, restructured codex/grok command docs) — maintainer instructions, no behavior change to the codebase.

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `go build ./...`; `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean)
- `go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.1.4 ./...` locally on go1.26.5 (GO-2026-5856 no longer reported)

Follow-ups:
- Unblocks the Pass-7 audit PR (#144) and the product-docs PR (#145), which were green on every check except this `vuln` gate.

## 2026-07-10 — docs(audit): seventh design & implementation pass (P7)

Changed:
- `docs/audits/AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-07-10_PASS7.md` (new): seventh pass against trunk `d667530`, 47 findings (P1=1, P2=25, P3=21) across ten dimensions (SEC/SYNC/HUB/GIT/CLI/DATA/QUAL/XP/DOC/PROD). Verification-driven multi-agent workflow — opus-4.8 / GPT-5.6 / Grok-4.5 reviewers, every candidate adversarially verified, every candidate P1 double-verified; three candidate P1s downgraded to P2 by cross-checking verifiers, leaving one confirmed P1 (`P7-SYNC-01`: device revocation erased by compaction + absent from snapshots). Appendix A maps extensions to the open Pass-4/5 backlog; Appendix B collects six exa-backed external anchors.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: added the Pass-7 index row + a `### Pass 7 — 47 open of 47` open-findings table (header count == rows) + a dated blockquote note. Reconciled the ledger per convention #3: corrected the **Pass-5 count to 35 shipped / 1 open (`P5-CLI-01`)** — both prior counts (index "33/3", header "34/2") were stale, and `contextcheck` is a `P4-QUAL-07` sub-item, not a Pass-5 row (replaced the ~36-row Pass-5 table with an open-only table + a correction note); corrected the **Pass-6 index status to closed**; updated the **Pass-4 index status** to ~32 shipped / ~12 open; reworded the *Recently shipped* invariant note from a hand-listed "seven" to the ID-prefix filter rule (16 non-`P6-` rows now exist; the `= 0` arithmetic was unaffected).
- `spec/00`, `spec/12`, `spec/14`, `spec/17`: appended the new pass file to `tracks_code`, bumped `last_reviewed` to 2026-07-10; spec/00's "latest pass" pointer now names Pass 7.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean — doc-only cycle, no Go changes)
- `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (exercises `TestEveryCommandIsDocumented`, `TestMigrationsDocumented`, and the spec-drift real-repo regression gate)
- Ledger invariants re-counted: Pass-7 header "47 open" == 47 table rows; findings-at-a-glance totals (1/25/21) == per-dimension column sums == index-row count; corrected Pass-5 header "1 open" == 1 open-table row.

Follow-ups:
- The 47 findings are recommendations, not yet implemented; per-finding fix PRs follow (highest priority: `P7-SYNC-01`, then `P7-QUAL-02`/`P7-SEC-02`/`P7-HUB-02` and the `P7-DATA-03/04/05` backup-hardening cluster). `P7-DOC-01` (six files describing shipped `devstrap service` + OS sandbox as unbuilt) is a cheap early win.
- The Pass-4 open count (~12) is ledger-text-derived; a row-by-row Pass-4 re-verification against current code is itself a `P7-DOC` follow-up.
- Commercialization (`spec/20`) and website (`spec/21`) plans ship in a separate PR that consumes the `P7-PROD`/`P7-HUB` cost-and-readiness findings.
## 2026-07-07 — fix(agent): grant the linked worktree's git dirs to the OS sandbox (P7-SANDBOX-01)

Changed:
- `internal/git/git.go`: new `Runner.WorktreeSandboxWriteDirs` — resolves the linked worktree's git storage a `git add`/`commit` writes: `<git-common-dir>/{objects,refs,logs}` + the per-worktree admin dir (`--git-dir`). Deliberately EXCLUDES the common dir itself (and thus `hooks/`/`config`): granting those would let a sandboxed agent plant a hook/config that executes UNSANDBOXED on a later git op (that's why it's a per-subpath grant, not a whole-common-dir grant — Landlock also cannot carve a read-only hole out of an RW grant). Returns `(nil, nil)` outside a worktree; symlink-resolved paths.
- `internal/platform/sandbox.go`: new `SandboxSpec.GitDirs` (documented as excluding hooks/config).
- `internal/platform/sandbox_profile.go` (Seatbelt), `sandbox_bwrap_args.go` (bubblewrap `--bind-try`), `sandbox_landlock.go` (`RWDirs(...).WithRefer().IgnoreIfMissing()`): all three write allow-lists now include `spec.GitDirs`.
- `internal/platform/sandbox_read_confine.go`: `GitDirs` join the `--read-confine` allow-list so git reads work under the `readonly` policy.
- `internal/cli/agent.go`: resolve the git dirs at the run site (holds `*options`) and thread them through `runAgentProcess` → `agentSandboxSpec`; best-effort (a resolution failure leaves the grant empty rather than blocking the run).
- `spec/10`: documented the git-dir grant + the hooks/config exclusion rationale.

Why: a DevStrap agent worktree is a git *linked* worktree whose index/HEAD/objects/refs live in the parent clone's `.git`, outside the worktree dir. Under the default `guarded` policy with `--sandbox auto` (the common Mac dev host), the write confinement (worktree + tmp only) kernel-EPERM'd every `git add`/`git commit`, so `agent pr` had nothing to push — the core agent loop silently broke. The only prior e2e canary committed into a *fresh nested* repo, never exercising the linked-worktree path.

Post-review (dual review — opus + Codex gpt-5.5): opus verdict clean/ship-it, Codex needs-fix on two minors — both applied. (1) `git.go` now refuses a `--git-dir` that resolves outside `<common>/worktrees/` (a malformed gitfile/commondir could otherwise point `--git-dir` at `<common>/hooks` and slip it into the write grant — the security-invariant hardening), and symlink-resolves the `objects/refs/logs` subpaths (git alternates). (2) `agent.go` resolves the git dirs only when the sandbox is enabled (no wasted forks under `--sandbox off`, dead error branch dropped) and warns when an enabled-sandbox grant is unexpectedly empty (rather than silently regressing to the EPERM). Deferred by agreement (latent, `readonly` blocks commits anyway): the `--read-confine` common-`config` read path — tracked in Follow-ups.

Validated:
- `gofmt`/`go vet`/`golangci-lint run` clean (0 issues) on the touched packages; `go build ./...`.
- `go test ./internal/platform/... ./internal/git/... ./internal/cli/...` pass, incl. new `TestWorktreeSandboxWriteDirs` (security invariants: never the common root/hooks/config), `TestSBPLProfileGrantsGitDirs`, `TestBwrapArgsGrantsGitDirs`, `TestReadConfineRootsIncludesGitDirs`.
- **Load-bearing proof on a real Mac** (`DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E=1 go test -run TestSeatbeltAllowsLinkedWorktreeCommit`): a `git add && git commit` in a real linked worktree under the live Seatbelt kernel sandbox FAILS without the git-dir grant and SUCCEEDS with it, landing the commit on the branch.

Follow-ups (review-surfaced; separate findings, out of scope for this focused P1 fix):
- Linux backends (bubblewrap/Landlock) are covered by the shared `GitDirs` wiring + arg tests; the Docker `sandbox_landlock_e2e_test` could be extended to a real linked worktree for parity.
- Ledger: RESOLVED on rebase — the merged Pass-7 audit (#144, reorganized from the superseded #141 draft) carries no `P7-SANDBOX-01` row (the ID was the draft's numbering; the fix was already in flight when the final audit was assembled), so there is no ledger row to move. The ID is kept in this entry/PR title as a historical pointer to the draft.
- **`--read-confine` git-read completeness:** under the `readonly` policy (`--read-confine` on) the linked worktree's `<git-common-dir>/config` is not in the read allow-list, so `git status`/`git log` may not read core config; this policy already blocks commits at the CLI token-scan, so it is latent, but read ops could be tightened by exposing the common dir read-only (write still confined to objects/refs/logs/admin).
- **commondir-redirect escape (PRE-EXISTING, not widened here):** the per-worktree admin dir grant includes the `commondir`/`gitdir` pointer files; overwriting `commondir` (or a `<worktree>/.git` file, writable since the original WorktreeDir grant) can redirect git to an agent-controlled tree carrying an evil `config` (`core.fsmonitor=<cmd>`) or hooks that `agentDiffSummary`'s post-run `git status`/`agent pr` would execute UNSANDBOXED. This class predates this PR (the `<worktree>/.git` vector already existed) and is not enlarged by it. Fix belongs in a separate finding: harden the environment (`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` is already set; add `core.fsmonitor=false`/`-c protocol...`, or re-validate `.git`/`commondir` point at the expected admin dir) before any unsandboxed git op on an agent-touched worktree.
- **Clone-scoped, not branch-scoped:** `<common>/{objects,refs}` are shared by every linked worktree of the clone, so a sandboxed agent can rewrite sibling branches / write arbitrary objects in the shared clone (integrity, not RCE) — inherent to git's linked-worktree model; the spec text is honest about the "shared object store." Worth acknowledging in the threat model as clone-scoped isolation.

## 2026-07-06 — docs: unattended-operation wave close-out (PRs #136–#139)

Changed:
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: new `DIRECTION — unattended-operation wave (2026-07-06): COMPLETE` bullet recording the four shipped items (issue #133 draft-pending quarantine, issue #134 self-healing WCK rotation, `P4-GIT-04` squash-merge worktree GC, `P4-PROD-04` `devstrap service`), the remaining backlog after the wave, and the Pass-7 audit as the natural next checkpoint.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: the intro blockquote's wave trail extended with the 2026-07-06 completion note (both ledger row moves happened in their own PRs; header counts unchanged).

Validated:
- Docs-only; ledger open-count invariant unaffected (no rows moved in this PR).

Follow-ups:
- None (wave complete).


## 2026-07-06 — feat(service): devstrap service install|uninstall|status (P4-PROD-04)

Changed:
- `internal/platform`: `ServiceSpec` enriched (Description, WorkingDir, launchd-only Stdout/StderrPath, RestartOnFailure, RestartDelaySeconds); `ServiceManager` gains `DefaultLabel()` and `Install` returns `(notes, err)` — the notes channel exists so the Linux linger advisory originates in the adapter (the goos-guard ban keeps OS branching out of the CLI); `ServiceStatus.UnitPath`. Untagged pure logic (`service_launchd.go`/`service_systemd.go`, golden-tested on every OS): plist render via text/template with `encoding/xml.EscapeText` on every value (`KeepAlive{SuccessfulExit:false}`, `RunAtLoad`, `ThrottleInterval` 30s default), unit render (`Type=simple`, `Restart=on-failure`, `StartLimit*`, `WantedBy=default.target`, `systemdQuote` with `%%` escaping), modern `launchctl bootstrap/bootout/print` argv builders (never load/unload), tolerant `parseLaunchctlPrint`, shared `atomicWrite`. Tagged managers: `LaunchdManager` (label `com.devstrap.run-loop`, `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, idempotent bootout→poll-until-gone→bootstrap, logs under `~/.devstrap/logs/run-loop.{out,err}.log`) and `SystemdUserManager` (label `devstrap-run-loop`, `~/.config/systemd/user`, availability probe → typed `ErrUnsupported`, write→daemon-reload→enable→restart, linger advisory note); wired into `Detect()`.
- `internal/cli/service.go` (+ root registration, `serviceBackend` seam): `service install [--interval|--namespace-only|--hub-file|--label|--exec-path]` refuses an unconfigured hub (a service that fails every tick just manufactures a restart loop) and an ephemeral default exec path (temp dir / go-build; explicit `--exec-path` honored but must be absolute); bakes `run-loop` args, absolutizing `--hub-file` and any explicitly-set `--home/--root/--config`; `Env` stays nil (adapters add PATH only). `service uninstall` idempotent; `service status` honors `--json`. Doctor `run-loop service` check: unsupported → omitted, not installed → ok with install hint, installed-but-stopped → warn with inspect/reinstall remedy.
- **Live dogfood on a real Mac caught two real bugs pre-merge** (worker-run, re-verified live): (1) `launchctl print` emits the service's top-level `state = running` before nested per-endpoint `state = active` lines — last-match parsing misreported a live service as not running; parse now takes each key's FIRST occurrence. (2) `bootout` tears down asynchronously, so an immediate reinstall's `bootstrap` raced the dying job (`Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error`); install now polls `print` until the label leaves the domain (bounded ~3s) before bootstrapping.
- Post-review fixes (coordinator + Codex dual-review): **label validation** (`validateServiceLabel`, `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`) gates every adapter entry point — a `--label ../../evil` previously wrote/deleted files OUTSIDE the LaunchAgents/systemd dir via `filepath.Join` and corrupted launchctl domain targets; **fail-closed control-character gate** (`rejectServiceControlChars`) in BOTH renderers — systemd units are line-oriented, so a `\n` in an exec path/arg/env value injected arbitrary directives past `systemdQuote` (Codex HIGH), and raw control bytes make launchd reject the plist silently; **propagated `--home/--root/--config` are absolutized** like `--hub-file` (a relative path baked into a unit resolves against the supervisor's cwd, not the install-time cwd). Accepted as-is: `atomicWrite` guarantees no partial read, not crash-durability (Codex Low).
- Specs: spec/00 (command inventory + "Not implemented yet" truth-up), spec/05 (shipped `service install` replaces the deferred `daemon install` framing; PLAT-05 resolved; exit-78/127 troubleshooting), spec/06 (unit shape, linger, fail-closed keychain note — no `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN` auto-bake per P6-XP-04), spec/13 (`### service` section + inventories), spec/14 (both installer rows flipped `[x]`), spec/16; ledger `P4-PROD-04` → *Recently shipped*.

Validated:
- Untagged golden/argv/parse suites both renderers (incl. `TestRenderersRejectControlCharacters`, `TestValidateServiceLabel`, the real-dogfood `parseLaunchctlPrint` fixture); darwin PATH-shim manager tests; linux manager tests green in Docker (golang:1.26); CLI fake-manager matrix (temp-path refusal, hub refusal, notes, env-no-secrets, `--json`, idempotent uninstall); doctor warn test; `TestEveryCommandIsDocumented`.
- gofmt; `go build` darwin+linux; `GOOS=linux go vet`; golangci-lint 0 issues; `go test -race ./...`; spec-drift vs origin/main.
- Live dogfood: fresh install → real launchd tick ("run-loop tick: scan + sync + materialize"), status running with pid, reinstall over running service, uninstall + idempotent re-uninstall; no residue left.

Follow-ups:
- Native Linux golangci-lint pass before the next Linux-touching PR (worker's in-container lint run exceeded budget; `GOOS=linux go vet` passed and the nolint annotations mirror darwin ones the linter accepted).
## 2026-07-06 — feat(worktree): cleanup reaps squash/rebase-merged worktrees (P4-GIT-04)

Changed:
- `internal/git/git.go`: new `Runner.IsSquashMerged(ctx, dir, branch, baseRef)` — offline content-equivalence via a **current-tree merge probe**: `git merge-tree --write-tree <base> <branch>` (git ≥ 2.38) reports merged only when the simulated merge's tree is IDENTICAL to the current base tree (the branch would contribute nothing — exactly a squash/rebase/cherry-pick-merge's effect). The first draft's `git cherry`/synthetic-commit/`patch-id --stable` chain was REPLACED in dual review: both reviewers independently proved (with repros) that patch-id equivalence matches HISTORICAL base commits, so a change merged-then-REVERTED on base — or a per-commit coincidence overruling cherry — would reap genuinely-unmerged work; the merge-tree probe compares against the current tree and is immune to the revert class. Conservative: a conflicting simulated merge, an older git, or any error → not merged.
- Documented accepted limitation (inherent to ANY content test): a branch whose net change also landed via an unrelated identical commit reads as merged — pinned by `TestIsSquashMergedMatchesCoincidentallyIdenticalDiff` (a tripwire naming spec/08), mitigated by the reap breadcrumb below.
- `internal/cli/worktree.go`: `worktree cleanup --merged` semantics extend to ancestry OR content-equivalent — the ancestry `git branch --merged` check stays first; only its misses consult `IsSquashMerged`. Reaps are labeled `merged` vs `merged (squash)` and print the deleted branch's tip SHA (`branch <name> was at <sha>`) as the recovery breadcrumb (`git branch <name> <sha>` restores until gc). New `refreshWorktreeBase` best-effort fetches the recorded `remote/branch` base under the repo lock, deduped per (project, base ref) per run (review finding: N worktrees must not trigger N fetches); warn + continue on stale/offline. Reaped worktrees also get `git branch -D` (warn-only), matching the P6-GIT-05 failure-cleanup precedent.
- Specs: spec/08 (merge-tree semantics, conservative rule, pinned limitation + breadcrumb, forge-API non-goal), spec/16 (test inventory).

Validated:
- New real-git tests: `TestIsSquashMergedDetectsSquashMerge`, `...DetectsRebaseMerge`, `...FalseForUnmerged`, `...ConservativeOnContentDivergence`, `...FalseAfterRevertOnBase` (the dual-review repro), `...MatchesCoincidentallyIdenticalDiff` (documented-limitation tripwire); CLI e2e `TestWorktreeCleanupReapsSquashMergedWorktree` (squash-merged reaped with `merged (squash)` + branch deleted + state row `removed`; unmerged untouched in the same run).
- gofmt clean; `go test -race ./...` all ok; golangci-lint; spec-drift vs origin/main.

Follow-ups:
- None (P4-GIT-04 moves to Recently shipped in the ledger).
## 2026-07-06 — feat(devices): self-healing WCK rotation after revoke (#134)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/wck_rotation.go` (new): the owed-rotation marker — a `wck_rotation_pending` `local_meta` row (JSON `{epoch, since}`, NO schema migration: the generic `GetLocalMeta`/`SetLocalMeta` accessors from P4-SYNC-02 already exist). The marker resolves ONLY via `clearWCKRotationPending` after THIS device's own successful `Rotate` (sync's owed retry, `keys rotate`, or a later revoke's rotation — every local Rotate wraps to `ApprovedRecipients`, which excludes all locally-revoked devices, exactly the proof the marker needs); a marker that fails to parse stays pending (fail-closed). New `state.Store.DeleteLocalMeta` (idempotent).
- `internal/cli/devices.go`: `rotateWorkspaceKeyOnRevoke` records the marker on `Rotate` failure (warning promises the sync auto-retry; falls back to manual-only wording if even the marker write fails) and clears it on any later successful revoke rotation; new `warnMalformedRemainingRecipients` preflights the REMAINING approved recipients before the trust write (issue #134 option 3) via new `workspacekeys.ValidateRecipient` — advisory only, the revoke always proceeds (refusing would keep a compromised device approved, per the PR #132 adversarial ruling); Rotate's wrap-first ordering stays the enforcement.
- `internal/cli/sync.go`: `maybeRotateWorkspaceKey` rotates when a rotation is OWED regardless of epoch age — and even with `keys.rotate_max_age=0`, since disabling PERIODIC rotation must not disable committed revoke containment. An owed retry that fails EARLY (epoch unchanged — the malformed-recipient class) warns loudly and lets the cycle CONTINUE; a failure with the epoch advanced (mid-commit half-mint, grants possibly unpublished) is fatal for the cycle, detected by re-reading the epoch. Success clears the marker (a delete failure is a cycle error — the marker must not silently outlive its rotation). `keys rotate` clears it too. Epoch-0 skip unchanged (a joiner never self-mints).
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: new `workspace key rotation` check — warns `owed since <ts>` with the sync-auto-retry + `keys rotate` remedy; silent when nothing is owed.
- Specs: spec/07 (revoke lifecycle bullet: preflight + marker + Rotate-only resolution + early-vs-mid-commit failure split), spec/13 (doctor check inventory), spec/15 (the TRUST-01 failed-rotation residual is now bounded by the next successful rotation; issue #134 shipped).

- Post-review (dual: Codex adversarial + opus, both converged on the same HIGH): the first draft self-resolved the marker when ANY epoch above the recorded one became active — unsound, because a peer that has not yet pulled the revoke (and it cannot have: the fatal-for-cycle draft also blocked pushing the `device.revoked` event) can rotate for AGE reasons and grant the new epoch to the still-approved-in-its-registry revoked device; the marker would clear while the revoked device holds the current key, and the self-resolve actively cancelled the retry that would have excluded it. Fixed: resolution is Rotate-only (above); the worst case of ignoring a legitimate peer rotation is one redundant epoch. The same fix covers the mid-commit-failure self-clear (Codex Medium). The fatal-for-cycle availability regression (Codex Medium / opus Major: a permanently-malformed bystander recipient blocked the revoke event from ever propagating AND run-loop aborted after 5 ticks) is fixed by the early-failure warn-and-continue split. Opus Minors: the doctor read-path DELETE side effect is gone with lazy resolution; the workspace-scoping mismatch is moot (the marker no longer compares epochs).

Validated:
- New: `TestDeviceRevokeRotationFailureMarksPendingAndSyncRetries` (malformed bystander recipient → preflight warning names it, marker at epoch 1, then fixed recipient + `rotate_max_age=0` → owed retry mints epoch 2 and clears the marker), `TestMaybeRotateWarnsAndContinuesCycleOnEarlyOwedFailure` (cycle proceeds, marker survives, epoch unchanged), `TestWCKRotationPendingSurvivesNewerEpoch` (the HIGH's regression pin), `TestKeysRotateClearsOwedRotation`, `TestWCKRotationPendingMalformedRecordStaysPending` (fail-closed), `TestDoctorWarnsWCKRotationPending`, `TestDeleteLocalMetaIdempotent`.
- gofmt clean; `go test -race ./...` all ok; golangci-lint; spec-drift vs origin/main.

Follow-ups:
- None (closes #134; the accepted residual — events pushed between the failed revoke rotation and this device's next successful rotation remain readable by the revoked device — is documented in spec/15).
## 2026-07-06 — fix(sync): draft-snapshot apply quarantines instead of aborting the pull batch (#133)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/events.go`: the `draft.snapshot.created` apply case mirrors the env pointer shape (issue #133) — a winning tombstone drops the pointer; an absent, non-tombstoned project returns the new `errDraftProjectPending` sentinel, quarantined by the batch loop as a cursor-consuming, replayable `draft_pending_project` conflict (new kind beside `env_pending_project`, shared `insertPendingProjectConflict`). The env replay generalizes to `ReplayPendingProjectConflicts` covering both kinds (call sites: post-pull apply in `internal/cli/sync.go`, approve-time replay in `internal/cli/devices.go`); draft re-apply re-runs `RecordDraftSnapshotTx` through the normal verified path and resolves the conflict only after a successful apply.
- Malformed-payload convention (the issue's same-class residual, both planes): a signed-but-malformed **draft or env** payload — JSON decode failure, an unsafe `pathkey.Clean` path, or (opus review) a blob ref that can never pass `RecordDraftSnapshotTx`'s `age_blob:` validation — now wraps `state.ErrEventVerification` at the APPLY layer, so it quarantines-as-consumed instead of aborting the batch or error-looping the pending replay once the project lands (only an APPROVED signer can reach these branches; mirrors the PR #132 trust-payload convention). The env decode/path wraps and the blob-ref validation were coordinator review additions on top of the delegated draft-side fix.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): confirmed-and-pinned rather than fixed — a pending-quarantined pointer is consumed for the cursor but never inserted into `events`, so the origin device's next CHAINED event breaks on `validatePrevEventHash` and holds that device's cursor. Verified this is a bounded temporary hold with existing recovery, not a wedge (the same shape the shipped env/undecryptable designs carry): the real CLI can never emit a draft before its own project.added (draft creation requires a local project), so the pending case is cross-device — and once the project lands, the replay inserts the pointer, the re-delivered successor applies, and its `event_hash_chain_break` conflict auto-resolves through the P6-SEC-03 resolve-by-event-id path. Pinned end-to-end by `TestApplyDraftSnapshotPendingChainSuccessorRecovers`; documented in spec/07.
- Specs: spec/07 (P6-SYNC-01 status: conflict-kind list, `ReplayPendingProjectConflicts`, the chain-hold note), spec/09 (renamed replay), spec/13 (sync pending-project replay), spec/16 (test inventory).

Validated:
- New: `TestApplyDraftSnapshotUnknownProjectQuarantinesWithoutAbort` (batch continues, cursor advances, `draft_pending_project` row), `TestApplyDraftSnapshotTombstonedProjectDrops`, `TestApplyDraftSnapshotMalformedPayloadQuarantinesWithoutAbort`, `TestApplyDraftSnapshotBadBlobRefQuarantinesWithoutAbort`, `TestApplyEnvProfileMalformedPayloadQuarantinesWithoutAbort`, `TestReplayPendingDraftSnapshotConflictRecovers`, `TestApplyDraftSnapshotPendingChainSuccessorRecovers`.
- gofmt clean; `go test -race ./...` all ok; golangci-lint; spec-drift vs origin/main.

## 2026-07-05 — docs(spec/19): §F.3 multi-device completeness dogfood runbook

Changed:
- `spec/19_CLOUD_PROVISIONING_GUIDE.md` §F.3: live-R2 validation log for the ENV-SYNC-01 + TRUST-01 wave (PRs #130–#132) — three devices, pairing-before-capture ordering, byte-identical cross-device hydrate, revocation propagation to a bystander via sync alone, post-revocation quarantine + epoch wedge-out, rotation-warning propagation on the fixed binary, and the dogfood-caught needs_rotation wipe (fixed in PR #132). Traps recorded: workspace-bound git carrier marker, `hub init` git-only bootstrap, count-not-label doctor assertions.

Validated:
- Docs-only; the run itself is the validation (all legs PASS on live R2; details in §F.3).

Follow-ups:
- None (wave complete; #133/#134 track the code follow-ups).

## 2026-07-05 — feat(devices): synced device-trust propagation (TRUST-01)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/events.go`: new `device.revoked`/`device.lost` events + `DeviceTrustPayload` (state derives from the event TYPE — one source of truth) + `NewDeviceTrustEvent`; apply case ensures a placeholder for an unknown target, applies the sticky flip, and flags `needs_rotation` ONLY when a row actually changed (replays never re-flag cleared rotations). `device.approved` is deliberately NOT an event — propagating approvals would let one compromised device enroll attackers fleet-wide; approval stays the local P4-SEC-04 fingerprint ceremony.
- `internal/state/store.go`: `SetDeviceTrustStateTx` (factored transactional core, refuse-local guard kept), `ApplyRemoteDeviceTrustTx` (sticky UPDATE `WHERE trust_state IN ('pending','approved')`; the local device NEVER flips from a remote event — a hub cannot talk a device into distrusting itself; returns `changed`), `MarkEncryptedBindingsNeedingRotationTx`; `mustVerifyEvent` gains both trust types.
- `internal/cli/devices.go`: `devices revoke`/`lost` write the trust flip + insert the synced event in ONE transaction (P6-DATA-03), BEFORE the WCK rotation — a rotation failure can never orphan the trust write, and the trust event's seq precedes the new epoch's grants; stderr notes the propagation.
- Semantics (design record): sticky/monotonic — revoked/lost are terminal for remote transitions, only a local approve ceremony resurrects; pending→revoked is the fail-closed direction (hasEnrolledDevices already counts revoked rows). Mutual revocation converges deterministically within one batch (HLC-earlier revoke wins; the counter-revoke fails verification once its signer flips and quarantines); across pull windows bystanders can diverge — ACCEPTED residual, fail-closed either way, loud (quarantine rows preserved), operator re-approves the survivor. No trust CRDTs by design (Keybase downgrade-lease analysis: full race-proofing needs an ordering service; wrong trade-off for a single-user fleet).
- Specs: spec/00/07/09/13/15/16 reconciled (the spec/07 "revoke is local-only" gap, the spec/15 P6-SYNC-01 residual, and spec/13's future-work line are retired); spec/14 `TRUST-01` flipped shipped.

- `internal/sync/trust_apply_test.go`: flip+rotation flagging, sticky replay no-reflag, unknown-target placeholder, untrusted-signer quarantine, local-target no-op, mutual-revocation both-order determinism, post-revoke same-batch quarantine isolation. `TestApplyRemoteDeviceTrustTxMatrix` (state) pins the transition matrix incl. remote-approve rejection. `TestDeviceRevokeEmitsTrustEvent` (cli) pins same-tx emission.
- e2e `sync_trust_propagation.txtar`: three devices, full mutual pinning; A revokes B → C learns via sync, doctor flags rotation, B's subsequent push quarantines on C.
- gofmt; darwin+linux builds; golangci-lint 0 issues; `go test -race ./...`; spec-drift.

- Post-dogfood fix (live R2 run F.3 caught it): `UpsertEnvProfileTx`'s replace-all-bindings upsert was silently WIPING `needs_rotation` — a revoke flags the bindings, then the rewrap's superseding `env.profile.updated` re-inserted fresh rows with the flag cleared, on the revoker AND on every receiving device (breaking P5-PROD-03 doctor surfacing; the txtar's `stdout 'rotation'` assertion was too weak to catch it — it matched the label in "rotation 0"). The upsert now carries each var's flag forward (clearing stays the explicit device-local `env rotate` action); pinned by `TestUpsertEnvProfileTxPreservesNeedsRotation` and the hardened txtar assertion (`secrets needing rotation [1-9]`).
- Post-review (opus reviewer, dual-review): (Minor) spec/07's shipped-event catalog now lists `device.revoked`/`device.lost` (the diff had only removed them from the planned block); (Minor) a signed-but-malformed trust payload (decode failure / empty target) now wraps `ErrEventVerification` so it quarantines-as-consumed instead of aborting the batch — only an APPROVED signer can produce one (mustVerify), exactly the compromised-device class these events cut off; pinned by `TestApplyDeviceTrustMalformedPayloadQuarantinesWithoutAbort` (the env/draft malformed-payload convention is tracked in #133).
- Post-review (Codex adversarial, dual-review): (HIGH, partially accepted) a failed WCK rotation during revoke leaves the old epoch active so pre-rotation pushes (incl. the revoke event) stay readable by the revoked device — the fail-closed-revoke suggestion was REJECTED (refusing the revoke keeps a compromised device approved, strictly worse; rotation failure is a pre-existing P4-SEC-07 warn path); accepted the loudness half: the CLI now names the exposure and the `keys rotate` remedy, spec/15 documents the residual, fail-closed/auto-retry rotation filed as follow-up. (HIGH, residual confirmed + hardened) cross-window mutual-revocation divergence stays the documented accepted trade (no trust CRDTs/ordering service for a single-user fleet), but the review exposed an undocumented recovery trap — re-approving one side replays its quarantined counter-revoke, flipping the other — now pinned by `TestApplyMutualRevocationCrossWindowDivergesLoudly` (both bystanders diverge LOUDLY with the loser preserved in an open conflict) and documented as the two-step recovery in spec/07.

Follow-ups:
- Fail-closed or auto-retrying WCK rotation on revoke (adversarial-review follow-up).
- Bounded conflict-row aggregation for a still-pushing revoked device (pre-existing).
- Cross-window mutual-revocation divergence: documented accepted residual (spec/07).

## 2026-07-05 — feat(env): cross-device env-profile exchange (ENV-SYNC-01)

Changed:
- `internal/sync`: added `env.profile.updated` payload/event helpers and apply handling. Env profile replay is LWW by source-event coordinate, duplicates/stale events are idempotent, and the event is signature-gated as trust-affecting.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2) the apply path no longer consumes a verified env event whose project has not applied yet — a tombstoned path drops the pointer, an absent-without-tombstone path quarantines as a replayable `env_pending_project` conflict (cursor advances, batch never aborts) and `ReplayPendingEnvProfileConflicts` recovers it after every pull apply and after `devices approve` replay, pinned by `TestApplyEnvProfileEventUnknownProjectQuarantinesWithoutAbort`/`...TombstonedProjectDrops`; (P2) `rewrapHubCleanup` now uploads the rewrapped blob BEFORE pushing the superseding event (a peer that applies the event can always fetch the ciphertext it names; a failed event push self-heals on the next sync because superseding events are ordinary local events), pinned by `TestRewrapHubCleanupUploadsBlobBeforeEvent` — this also fixes the pre-existing draft-rewrap ordering.
- `internal/state`: migration `00023_env_profile_source_events.sql` adds `env_profiles.source_event_hlc/source_event_device_id/source_event_id`; env profile saves now share `Tx.UpsertEnvProfileTx`, stamp event coords, keep legacy wrappers for tests/callers, and expose `EnvProfileSourceCoords` plus `EnvProfilesForBlobRef`.
- `internal/cli`: `env capture` and `env bind` emit `env.profile.updated` in the same transaction as the profile upsert; sync blob discovery includes env profile blob refs; hydrate missing local blobs now carries a `devstrap sync` remedy; revoke rewrap emits superseding env profile events before hub cleanup.
- Snapshot plane (coordinator follow-up in the same PR): `SnapshotEnv` pointer on `SnapshotEntry` (state read `snapshotEnvForProject` skips never-synced NULL-coord profiles), `BuildSnapshot` mapping, `importEnvTx` merging by the pointer's OWN coordinate even when the entry row loses the project LWW, and `recoverFromSnapshot` step 8 pulls imported env blobs alongside draft blobs.
- Review fixes (coordinator line-by-line): `rewrapEnvBlob` regained the catch-all `UpdateBlobRef` so bindings on tombstoned entries repoint too (EnvProfilesForBlobRef only sees active projects); `UpsertEnvProfileTx` dropped an unreachable provider branch.
- Specs: `spec/00`, `spec/07`, `spec/09`, `spec/12`, and `spec/16` now describe shipped env-profile exchange, the snapshot env pointer, and migration 00023.

Validated:
- Added state, sync, and CLI unit coverage for env profile source coords, blob-ref lookup, apply idempotency/LWW/pending-quarantine/tombstone-drop, local capture event emission, env blob discovery, and revoke rewrap superseding events + blob-before-event ordering.
- Focused package run: `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state/... ./internal/sync/... ./internal/cli/...`.

Follow-ups:
- file the draft-apply batch-abort finding (a draft.snapshot.created or malformed-but-verified env payload for an unknown project can still abort a whole pull batch; the env apply path now tombstone-drops or quarantines-for-replay instead — the draft handler should adopt the same shape).

## 2026-07-05 — docs(audits): Pass-6 closure banner + ledger truth-up + multi-device wave direction

Changed:
- `docs/audits/AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-07-01_PASS6.md`: the "Status as of 2026-07-04" banner now states the final 43/43 closure (it still listed six findings as open that shipped 2026-07-04).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P4-QUAL-04` narrowed — the coverage-in-CI half shipped (ci.yml 50% `go tool cover -func` floor, closing `P5-QUAL-04`, whose Pass-5 row is now annotated shipped); remaining scope is the Windows build only. Intro pointer to the chosen next wave.
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: new `DIRECTION — multi-device completeness wave (2026-07-05)` bullet with backlog rows `ENV-SYNC-01` (synced env-bundle exchange) and `TRUST-01` (synced device-trust propagation) — direction workstream IDs, not audit finding IDs, per the pass-scoped-ID convention.

Validated:
- Docs-only change; ledger header counts re-derived from their tables (open-count invariant holds).

Follow-ups:
- Implement `ENV-SYNC-01` then `TRUST-01` (next PRs in this wave).

## 2026-07-05 — feat(agent): tighter read confinement for the OS sandbox (P4-GIT-03 slice 6, COMPLETES P4-GIT-03)

Changed:
- `internal/platform/sandbox.go`: `SandboxSpec` gains `ReadConfine bool` + `ReadAllowExtra []string`; new `ReadConfineEnforcement` grade + optional `SandboxReadConfinement` interface (kept separate from `SandboxCapabilities` so adding it breaks no implementers).
- `internal/platform/sandbox_read_confine.go` (new, build-tag-free): `readConfineRoots(spec)` — the worktree/tmp, the running OS's toolchain/system roots (per-OS tables), the `$HOME` build caches (`.cache`, `go`, `.cargo`, …; credential dirs deliberately excluded), and absolute `ReadAllowExtra`, deduped.
- Backends: the Seatbelt profile denies all reads, allows `file-read-metadata` globally (stat/traversal), re-allows the roots, and keeps the credential denies LAST (SBPL last-match-wins) so a credential inside an allowed root stays denied; bubblewrap swaps `--ro-bind / /` for enumerated `--ro-bind-try <root>` and skips the now-subsumed credential masks; Landlock restricts its `RODirs` grant to the roots — which gives the additive-allow fallback a credential-read boundary it otherwise lacks. All three implement `ReadConfineEnforcement() == ReadConfineEnforced`; the Linux chooser delegates.
- `internal/cli/agent.go`: `--read-confine auto|on|off` (env `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_READ_CONFINE`, default `auto` = on for `readonly` only) + repeatable `--read-allow <abs>`; `resolveAgentSandbox` validates the mode up front (typo fails closed), then honors it only when the backend enforces it — an explicit `on` or `require` refuses to launch otherwise, an auto-derived request warns.

Key decisions:
- bwrap uses enumerated `--ro-bind-try` roots rather than composing Landlock inside bwrap (the plan's alternative): simpler, debuggable, and it makes `require` satisfiable on any backend without a Landlock-ABI dependency. `--ro-bind-try` never fails on an absent root, sidestepping the enumerate-and-hard-fail trap.
- Credential masks are omitted under read confinement (every credential path is outside the allow-list, so read confinement subsumes them; their parents may not even exist in the confined namespace).
- Default-on only for `readonly` — the profile already meant to be strictly read-scoped; extending to cautious/guarded waits until telemetry proves the allow-list survives real toolchains.
- A global `(allow file-read-metadata)` is a deliberate, documented path-existence leak; the alternative breaks nearly every tool that stats `$HOME`.
- Dual-review (Codex) fixes: (1) an explicit `--read-confine on` now fails closed when NO sandbox is available (it previously degraded to an advisory run in `auto` mode — an explicit knob must not silently no-op); (2) a `--read-allow` root that overlaps a protected credential path is refused pre-worktree — read confinement drops bwrap's masks and Landlock cannot subtract from an allowed root, so such a root would otherwise re-expose the credential (`FirstReadAllowCredentialConflict`).

Tests:
- All-platform: `TestReadConfineRoots`, `TestSBPLProfileReadConfineOrdering` (+ `TestSBPLProfileReadConfineOffIsUnchanged` keeps the non-confined profile byte-identical), `TestBwrapArgsReadConfineEnumeratesRootsAndSkipsMasks`, `TestResolveAgentSandboxReadConfineMatrix`.
- Linux e2e (`DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E=1`, verified in Docker on kernel 6.12): read confinement kernel-denies a credential read that is allowed without it, while a worktree read still works and the shim re-exec succeeds (test-binary dir added via `ReadAllowExtra`).

Validated:
- `gofmt`; `go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...` + vet; `golangci-lint run` 0 issues; `go test ./...` all ok; `spec-drift --base origin/main` passes; Docker Landlock+read-confine e2e green.

Follow-ups:
- The `P4-GIT-03` named trio (seccomp, `sandbox.violation` telemetry, tighter read confinement) is COMPLETE. Remaining OS-sandbox direction: containerization (spec/14), Linux runtime denial detection, macOS `mach-lookup` tightening — separate future work, not `P4-GIT-03` remainders.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(agent): sandbox.violation telemetry (P4-GIT-03 slice 5)

Changed:
- `internal/state`: migration `00022_sandbox_telemetry.sql` adds `agent_runs.sandbox_backend`, `sandbox_mode`, `sandbox_limitations`, plus the unsigned local `sandbox_violations` table (coordinates + scrubbed reason fields only). Store APIs now round-trip the sandbox run columns, append/query/count violation rows, and expose `TimestampNow()` so CLI telemetry uses the DB's timestamp layout.
- `internal/platform`: `SandboxSpec.ViolationTag` lets Seatbelt deny rules embed a per-run `(with message ...)` tag; Seatbelt implements optional `SandboxViolationReporter` by querying `/usr/bin/log show` after the run, and the build-tag-free parser extracts `operation`, `path`, and raw detail from denial lines.
- `internal/cli`: `agent run` records backend/mode/limitations, tags macOS Seatbelt profiles, collects violations post-run best-effort, scrubs path/detail with `redact.Scrub`, emits capped `slog.Warn("sandbox.violation", ...)` lines, and persists every row. `agent show` prints sandbox metadata and violation rows; `--json` wraps the run with a `violations` array. `doctor` adds the local DB-only "agent sandbox violations" check.
- Specs and audit ledger: `spec/10/12/13/14/15/16` and `docs/audits/README.md` now mark unsigned local telemetry shipped while keeping Linux runtime denial detection and signed audit-log recording future.

Key decisions:
- This is deliberately **not** the signed `audit_log` from `spec/15`: it is local, unsigned, best-effort visibility like `sync_skipped_events`.
- Linux runtime denial detection is out of scope for this slice. Linux runs still populate backend/mode/limitations so operators can see which confinement backend and reduced guarantees applied.
- SBPL deny forms remain byte-for-byte single-line when untagged; tagged runs expand only the deny forms to include `(with message "<run tag>")`.

Tests:
- Added/extended `TestParseSeatbeltDenials`, `TestParseSeatbeltDenialsSkipsEmptyAndGarbage`, `TestSBPLProfileEmbedsViolationTag`, `TestAgentRunSandboxColumnsRoundTrip`, `TestSandboxViolationsRoundTripAndCount`, `TestSandboxTelemetryHelpers`, `TestCollectSandboxViolationsPersistsScrubbedRows`, and `TestCheckSandboxViolations`.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go vet ./...`.
- `golangci-lint run` 0 issues; `go test ./...` all packages ok (including the new state/platform/cli telemetry tests); `spec-drift --base origin/main` passes.

Follow-ups:
- Tighter read confinement.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(agent): seccomp syscall denylist for the Linux sandbox (P4-GIT-03 slice 4)

Changed:
- `internal/platform/sandbox.go`: the `Sandbox.Command` seam now returns a `SandboxCommand{Argv, ExtraFiles, Cleanup}` struct instead of `([]string, func(), error)`, so a backend can hand the launcher inherited fds (bubblewrap's `--seccomp <fd>`). `Cleanup` is always non-nil-safe; all implementers (Unsupported/Seatbelt/Bubblewrap/Landlock/LinuxSandbox chooser) and every test fake were migrated. `SandboxSpec` gains `DenyDangerousSyscalls bool`, which rides the existing spec-JSON transport to the Landlock shim.
- `internal/platform/sandbox_seccomp_names.go` (new, build-tag-free): `seccompDeniedSyscalls`, grouped with rationale (mount / kernel-module-boot / tracing / keyring / escape-primitives / io_uring). `clone`/`clone3`/`unshare`/`setns`, `execve`/`execveat`/`fork`, and `ioctl` are deliberately NOT denied (nested sandboxes, the agent's own launches, and the documented `ioctl`-arg-filter gap).
- `internal/platform/sandbox_seccomp_linux.go` (new, `//go:build linux`): compiles the denylist with `github.com/elastic/go-seccomp-bpf` — Allow default, one `ActionErrno` (EPERM) group; `seccompFilterProgram` assembles → `bpf.Assemble` → native-endian `sock_filter` bytes; `seccompProgramFile` writes an `unix.MemfdCreate` fd for bwrap; `applySeccompSelf` loads it in-process (NoNewPrivs+TSYNC) for the Landlock shim; `probeSeccomp` (`OnceValues`) detects kernel support.
- `internal/platform/sandbox_bwrap_args.go`: the pure builder gains `bwrapOptions.SeccompFD` (0 = none) and renders `--seccomp <fd>` before the namespace/terminal/chdir args; `sandbox_linux.go` creates the memfd (fd 3, first ExtraFiles slot), passes it through, and closes it in Cleanup. `sandbox_landlock.go` calls `applySeccompSelf` after the ruleset and before `execve`. Both gate on `spec.DenyDangerousSyscalls && probeSeccomp()==nil`; a probe failure is a `Limitations()` line, not an error (fs/network boundary intact) — `require` still passes.
- `internal/cli/agent.go`: `resolveAgentSandbox` sets `DenyDangerousSyscalls` true for every enabled sandbox (unconditional hardening) and parses the `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_SECCOMP` escape hatch (empty/`on` → true, `off` → false with a stderr notice, anything else → invalid-config exit class, mirroring `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_BACKEND`); `runAgentProcess` wires `SandboxCommand.ExtraFiles` into `exec.Cmd.ExtraFiles`. The `--sandbox` `--help` text documents the new env var.

Key decisions:
- elastic/go-seccomp-bpf's `Assemble` FAILS (not skips) on any syscall name absent from the arch's table, and several denied names (`vm86`, `vm86old`, `modify_ldt`, `_sysctl`, `uselib`, `ustat`) are x86-only. `seccompPolicy` therefore filters the denylist against `arch.GetInfo("").SyscallNames` before assembling, so assembly can never fail at runtime on arm64. The assembled program is audit-arch-gated by the library (a mismatch falls through to the default Allow, never crashes); we assemble for the native `runtime.GOARCH`, so the gate always matches, and the x32 sub-ABI is filtered to ENOSYS by the library.
- `ActionErrno` auto-ORs EPERM (library `Ret`), so the denied group returns EPERM without an explicit errno.
- Landlock has no `--new-session` analogue and seccomp does not arg-filter `ioctl`, so `TIOCSTI` terminal injection stays open on the Landlock path — documented in spec/10 and spec/15.

Tests:
- All-platform: `TestSeccompDeniedSyscallNames` (golden groups; asserts clone/clone3/unshare/setns/execve/openat/ioctl are NOT denied), `TestBwrapArgsSeccompFD` (`--seccomp 3` present and before `--chdir`/`--new-session`; absent without a fd), and the seam migration across every existing sandbox test.
- Linux: `TestSeccompFilterProgramAssembles` (non-empty, `len%8==0`, instruction-count round-trip), `TestSeccompPolicyFiltersUnknownArchNames` (retained names all exist in the arch table). Env-gated E2E extended: a `keyctl(2)`→EPERM sub-assertion (via a re-exec probe in the landlock e2e `TestMain`) plus an over-blocking `git init`+empty-commit canary under both Linux backends' filters.
- `go.mod`/`go.sum`: added `github.com/elastic/go-seccomp-bpf v1.6.0` (+ its `golang.org/x/net` dep); both pure Go — `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build ./...` clean.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go vet ./...`; `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build ./...` clean.
- `golangci-lint run` (full module, darwin) 0 issues; `go test -race ./...` all packages ok. The Docker Linux kernel E2E (`DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E=1`) is run by the orchestrator.

Follow-ups:
- `sandbox.violation` telemetry.
- Tighter read confinement.

## 2026-07-05 — fix(agent): Seatbelt credential-deny symlink-leaf parity (P4-GIT-03 residual)

Changed:
- `internal/platform/sandbox_profile.go`: `sbplProfile` now takes pre-resolved credential deny lists (`sbplProfile(spec, denyReadDirs, denyReadFiles)`) instead of deriving them from `spec.UserHome`. Seatbelt matches the kernel-real path, so a deny on the literal `~/.ssh` never fired when `~/.ssh` was itself a symlink to an out-of-tree target — the credential stayed readable. The pure builder stays build-tag-free and now also guards against emitting a bare `(deny file-read*)` (which would deny ALL reads) when the lists are empty.
- `internal/platform/sandbox_paths_resolve.go` (new, build-tag-free): the shared fail-closed `existingRealPaths` resolver, moved out of the `//go:build linux` adapter so bubblewrap and Seatbelt share ONE copy of the drop-only-on-ErrNotExist rule and it cannot drift.
- `internal/platform/sandbox_darwin.go`: `seatbeltDenyPaths` derives the credential anchors via the shared `bwrapSensitivePaths`, then denies the deduped UNION of each literal alias and its symlink-resolved target — stronger than bwrap (which mounts, so uses only the resolved dest and drops absent ones): a Seatbelt deny rule is harmless on an absent or literal path, so it never drops, keeping every literal alias denied and every present-but-unresolvable path denied at its literal.
- Tests: updated the all-platform `sbplProfile` goldens for the new signature (asserting the builder renders exactly the caller lists and does not re-derive omitted anchors); added `TestSeatbeltResolvesCredentialLeafSymlinks` (unit: literal + resolved both denied, absent anchor keeps its literal); extended the env-gated darwin e2e `TestSeatbeltSandboxEnforcement` to read the key through both a `~/.ssh` symlink and its resolved target and assert both kernel-denied.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` clean; `go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...`; `go vet ./...`; `GOOS=linux go vet ./internal/platform/`; `golangci-lint run ./internal/platform/...` (darwin + `GOOS=linux`) 0 issues.
- `go test ./...` all packages ok; darwin kernel e2e `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E=1 go test -run TestSeatbeltSandboxEnforcement ./internal/platform/` PASS with the new resolved-target read sub-assertion (kernel-denied).

Follow-ups:
- Seccomp.
- `sandbox.violation` telemetry.
- Tighter read confinement.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(agent): Linux Landlock fallback sandbox for agent run (P4-GIT-03 slice 3)

Changed:
- `internal/platform`: Linux sandboxing is now a lazy chooser: bubblewrap first, Landlock fallback second, unsupported last. `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_BACKEND=bwrap|landlock` forces a backend and never silently falls back, so forced failures surface honestly to `--sandbox require`.
- `internal/platform/sandbox_landlock.go` + `internal/cli/sandbox_helper.go`: added the Landlock backend and hidden `devstrap sandbox-helper` re-exec shim. The shim applies Landlock to its own process, then `execve()`s the agent argv in the same PID so context-kill and child exit-code behavior are preserved; shim failures exit 125 and surface through the parent as `childExitBase+125`.
- Landlock policy: strict ABI v3 floor because v3 handles `TRUNCATE` and avoids the raw `truncate(2)` outside-worktree bypass; read+execute remains allowed everywhere; writes are confined to worktree + per-run tmp with `REFER` for Git object renames; device-node writes are allowed where shell/pty plumbing needs them; the log dir stays child-unwritable. The backend is additive-allow by design, so credential reads are NOT denied; network denial is TCP bind/connect only on ABI >= 4.
- `platform.SandboxCapabilities` and `agent run` resolution now surface reduced guarantees with one notice line, accept Landlock as satisfying `--sandbox require` for write confinement, and fail closed under `require` when `readonly`/`cautious` ask for a network deny the selected backend cannot enforce.
- Tests cover pure all-platform helper/limitation contracts, Linux chooser and Landlock adapter paths, hidden CLI shim behavior, capability resolution, and the env-gated kernel E2E. CI adds a hard-fail Landlock runner probe plus real-binary `sandbox-helper` smoke before the env-gated test can skip.
- `go.mod` / `go.sum`: added `github.com/landlock-lsm/go-landlock v0.9.0`.

Validated:
- Darwin: `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `test -z "$(gofmt -l cmd internal)"`; `go vet ./...`; `go build ./...`; `golangci-lint run`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- Linux: `GOOS=linux go vet ./...`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...`; `golangci-lint run` for the linux-tagged platform/cli packages; full `go test -race ./...` on the Ubuntu runner.
- Kernel E2E: `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E=1 go test ./internal/platform/ -run TestLandlockSandboxEnforcement` on Linux Docker kernel 6.12 proved outside-write denial, raw `truncate(2)` denial, `/dev/null` allowed, log-dir denial, credential read still succeeding (documented degrade), exit-code fidelity through the shim, and TCP deny at ABI >= 4.

Follow-ups:
- Seccomp.
- `sandbox.violation` telemetry.
- Tighter read confinement.
- Seatbelt symlink-leaf parity (next PR).

## 2026-07-05 — fix(agent): bubblewrap credential masks fail closed on resolution errors (P4-GIT-03 follow-up)

Changed:
- `internal/platform/sandbox_linux.go`: `existingRealPaths` previously dropped a credential mask on ANY `EvalSymlinks` error (CodeRabbit Major on PR #121). A mask backs `DenySensitiveReads`, so a non-not-exist error (permission-denied, symlink loop, I/O) silently left the credential path readable inside the sandbox. Now it drops ONLY on `os.ErrNotExist` (nothing to mask) and keeps the literal path on any other error — bwrap resolves the mount dest itself, so the symlink target stays masked; if the dest genuinely cannot be mounted the run errors rather than proceeding with the credential exposed.
- `internal/platform/sandbox_linux_test.go`: `TestExistingRealPathsFailsClosed` pins the three cases (resolvable symlink → masked at target; present-but-unresolvable → literal kept; absent → dropped).
- `spec/15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`: clarified that permitted non-credential reads are a deliberate allow-default/read-only-root position with read-confinement as a named follow-up, not an uncovered gap (CodeRabbit Minor).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: recorded a new P4-GIT-03 residual — the macOS Seatbelt credential denies match literal `~/.ssh` while the bwrap masks resolve leaf symlinks; closing that parity needs the pure-`sbplProfile`/darwin-adapter boundary to pass resolved mask paths (mirroring `bwrapArgs`), so it is tracked rather than rushed into shipped macOS security code.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal`; `go vet ./...`; `GOOS=linux go vet ./...`; `go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...`; `golangci-lint run` (darwin + `GOOS=linux` platform pkg); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (the new linux-tagged test runs on the CI ubuntu runner and its `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E` enforcement job); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- Seatbelt symlink-leaf resolution parity (ledger P4-GIT-03 residual above).
- Landlock layered fallback, seccomp, `sandbox.violation` telemetry (unchanged).

## 2026-07-05 — feat(agent): Linux bubblewrap sandbox for agent run (P4-GIT-03 slice 2)

Changed:
- `internal/platform`: added the Linux `BubblewrapSandbox` adapter and wired Linux detection to it. Availability now probes a real bwrap namespace launch with a `--disable-userns` retry fallback, so userns-restricted hosts degrade honestly; command wrapping resolves symlinked sandbox paths, masks existing real credential targets, guards empty/dash child argv before probing, and returns a safe no-op cleanup.
- Added the pure all-OS bwrap argv builder and tests, sharing the Seatbelt sensitive-path lists so Linux credential masks stay in deny-list parity with the SBPL profile. Moved `resolveSandboxSpecPaths` out of the Darwin file and added a symlink-resolution test for worktree/tmp/log dirs plus missing deny-anchor tolerance.
- CLI help, CI, spec docs, and the audit ledger now record the Linux bubblewrap slice: CI installs bwrap on ubuntu-latest, pins the AppArmor userns sysctl best-effort, and hard-fails a runner probe before the env-gated enforcement test can skip.
- The broad agent lifecycle CLI test now passes `--sandbox off` for its generic command-success/failure assertions so ordinary `go test ./internal/cli/` remains deterministic on hosts that expose `sandbox-exec` but reject nested Seatbelt profiles; the dedicated sandbox matrix and platform E2E tests cover sandbox behavior.
- Post-review (dual review — Fable-5 line-by-line + Opus-4.8 adversarial + Codex; Codex clean, Opus 4×P3, all folded in): the `--sandbox off` change above dropped the only end-to-end coverage of `runAgentProcess`'s sandbox-ENABLED branch, so a recording `passthroughSandbox` fake plus `TestAgentRunSandboxEnabledExecPath` now drive that glue hermetically on every platform (per-run TMPDIR create/repoint/teardown, argv wrapping, adapter cleanup); the probe now surfaces the compatible-mode (no-`--disable-userns`) stderr so bwrap < 0.8 no longer masks the real denial; the argv-shape test pins `--unshare-pid`; and the CI hard-probe mirrors the adapter's `--disable-userns`→plain-userns fallback.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `test -z "$(gofmt -l cmd internal)"`; `go vet ./...`; `GOOS=linux go vet ./...`; `go build ./...`; `GOOS=linux go build ./...`; `golangci-lint run` (darwin + `GOOS=linux` for the platform/cli packages); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- Landlock layered fallback slice (re-exec helper; additive-allow so read-denial stays bwrap-only).
- `sandbox.violation` telemetry.
- Open question: should `/var/run/docker.sock` join the mask list? Deferred to keep Seatbelt deny-list parity.

## 2026-07-05 — chore: v0.1.1 released — supply-chain verification proven live (P4-SEC-05 / P4-QUAL-05)

Changed:
- **v0.1.1 is live** (release execution, recorded here; the shipped pipeline landed in PRs #115/#117/#119). Flow: `v0.1.1-rc.1` on `eb73e94` ran the new signing/SBOM/provenance pipeline end-to-end (SLSA `provenance` job's first live run); the full verification set passed against the published rc assets — `shasum -c` 4/4 OK, `cosign verify-blob --bundle checksums.txt.sigstore.json` → `Verified OK` at the exact documented workflow identity, `slsa-verifier verify-artifact` → PASSED on all four tarballs, SBOMs valid SPDX-2.3, binary smoke green, tap untouched by the rc (`skip_upload: auto`). `v0.1.1` was then promoted on the SAME commit (second live proof of the `GORELEASER_CURRENT_TAG` pin): tap got exactly ONE cask commit, stable-asset cosign/SLSA verification re-passed at the `v0.1.1` identity/tag, and `brew upgrade` moved 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 cleanly.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P4-QUAL-05` moved to *Recently shipped* (SBOM + provenance shipped AND live-verified); `P4-SEC-05` narrowed to notarization-only with the live-verification evidence and the 2026-09-01 Homebrew deadline.
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: the code-signing backlog row records the live verification; only Apple Developer ID + notarization remains.

Validated:
- The verification transcript above, executed against the real GitHub releases. `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- Apple Developer enrollment → set the five `MACOS_*` secrets (all at once) → rc + `spctl` verify → remove the cask quarantine-strip hook → close `P4-SEC-05`.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(release): dormant Apple notarization config + enrollment runbook (P4-SEC-05 remainder)

Changed:
- `.goreleaser.yaml`: a `notarize.macos` block wired to quill-style Developer ID signing + notary submission, DORMANT by design — `enabled: '{{ isEnvSet "MACOS_SIGN_P12" }}'` templates to false until the secret exists, and every credential field reads via `index .Env` so the block is inert with the secrets unset. Validated with `goreleaser check` at v2.17.0 (the same major the release action resolves). Once active, the cask's quarantine-strip hook gets removed (step 6 of the runbook).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: the GoReleaser step passes the five `MACOS_*` Actions secrets as env (empty today), so activation is purely "set the secrets".
- `RELEASING.md`: new "Enabling notarization" runbook — Apple Developer Program enrollment, Developer ID Application `.p12`, App Store Connect API `.p8`, the five `gh secret set` commands, `codesign`/`spctl` verification on an rc, and the hook-removal PR that closes `P4-SEC-05`. Records the hard deadline: Homebrew drops Gatekeeper-failing casks 2026-09-01.
- `spec/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`: the supply-chain bullet now reflects shipped SLSA provenance (PR #117) and the dormant notarize block (its "SLSA not-yet-shipped" sentence was stale).
- `spec/18_WORK_LOG.md` housekeeping: corrected the PR #117 entry's remaining-scope prose, which predated the rebase onto #115 (CodeRabbit post-merge finding, replied on the PR).

Validated:
- `go run github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@v2.17.0 check` (config valid with the dormant block); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- Maintainer: complete Apple Developer enrollment and set the five secrets (in progress, per the wave decision 2026-07-05); then the rc + hook-removal PR closes `P4-SEC-05`.

## 2026-07-05 — docs: human ARCHITECTURE.md + user-facing docs/ tier (AD-8)

Changed:
- **New `ARCHITECTURE.md`** (repo root) — the human "explanation" tier bridging the README and the `spec/` corpus: the managed-physical-namespace decision (real folders, StrapFS deferred), the Workspace Passport eager-materialization promise, the two-plane zero-knowledge hub (signed HLC event log + content-addressed encrypted blobs; envelope encryption; git/folder/R2 carriers), compaction + snapshot bootstrap, device trust + key custody, agent workspaces (fresh worktrees, recorded base SHA, guardrails + macOS Seatbelt sandbox), and what is deliberately not built (daemon, StrapFS, HTTP/SSE relay). One ASCII component sketch; every section ends with a `Depth: spec/XX_….md` pointer.
- **New `docs/` user tier** — `docs/install.md` (all install paths: Homebrew cask incl. quarantine-strip/unsigned note, `curl|sh`, release binary + checksums, `go install …@main`, source; requirements), `docs/quickstart.md` (the zero-infra first-run loop init → hub init → scan → sync → open, plus pairing a second device and the agent loop), `docs/self-hosting.md` (choosing/operating a hub: git/folder/R2 carriers, `hub compact`/`gc`/`migrate-events`, the zero-knowledge property). `docs/audits/` (audit archive) already existed.
- **`README.md` slimmed, not gutted** — Install keeps the two happy paths (cask + `curl|sh`) and links `docs/install.md`; Quickstart keeps the 8-line default loop and links `docs/quickstart.md` + `docs/self-hosting.md` (the long Scaling-up and Pair-a-second-device blocks moved into `docs/`); the Architecture section links `ARCHITECTURE.md` first then `spec/`; a new **Documentation** pointer block (+ ToC entry) points at docs/ for users, ARCHITECTURE.md for the big picture, spec/ for depth.
- `spec/00_START_HERE.md` document map — a user-facing-tier preamble points at `../ARCHITECTURE.md` and the three `../docs/*.md` guides above the design-corpus list.
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md` — the AD-8 direction bullet marks the docs-tier and `ARCHITECTURE.md` goals **SHIPPED 2026-07-05**.

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (command-doc drift test unaffected — no command inventory changed); every relative link in the new files resolves to a real path.

Follow-ups:
- The remaining AD-8 workstream items (fork-PR advisory gate, GitHub Discussions + good-first-issue labels, `AGENTS.md` reframe, second maintainer) stay open.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(ci): make the spec-drift/work-log gate advisory on fork PRs (AD-8, B1)

Changed:
- `internal/specdrift/specdrift.go`: extracted the CLI-output/exit-code logic that used to live inline in `cmd/spec-drift/main.go` into `PrintReport(stdout, stderr io.Writer, report Report, advisory bool) bool` so it's independently testable. Strict mode (`advisory=false`) is byte-identical to the pre-existing behavior — pass prints the one-line summary to stdout, fail prints `spec drift check failed:` plus each finding to stderr and asks for exit 1. Advisory mode never asks for a non-zero exit: a report with findings additionally prints one `::warning::spec-drift (advisory on fork PRs): <finding>` annotation per finding to stdout (so GitHub Actions surfaces them in the UI) ahead of the same human-readable finding list.
- `cmd/spec-drift/main.go`: added an `--advisory` bool flag (default false) wired straight into `specdrift.PrintReport`; `main` now just calls `os.Exit(1)` when it returns true.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: the `spec-drift` job's "Check spec drift" step now appends `--advisory` only when the PR's head repo differs from the base repo (`github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name != github.repository`) — i.e. fork PRs. Same-repo PRs and pushes to `main` keep the gate blocking.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: added a "Spec Drift and the Work Log" section documenting the work-log rule itself (previously undocumented there), that fork PRs run the gate in advisory mode (contributors may add the work-log/spec entries but aren't required to — the maintainer completes bookkeeping at merge), and that small fixes need no spec/work-log changes at all on fork PRs.
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: the AD-8 direction bullet marks the fork-advisory drift-gate goal SHIPPED 2026-07-05.

Validated:
- New tests `TestAdvisoryModeExitsCleanWithWarnings` and `TestStrictModeUnchanged` in `internal/specdrift/specdrift_test.go`.
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(release): SLSA v1 build provenance for release artifacts (P4-SEC-05 / P4-QUAL-05)

Changed:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: the `goreleaser` job now exposes a `hashes` output (base64 of `dist/checksums.txt`, already in sha256sum subject format) via a new `Compute provenance subjects` step, and a new `provenance` job runs the SLSA generic generator (`slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@v2.1.0`) to attach a keyless-signed `multiple.intoto.jsonl` attestation to the release (`base64-subjects` from the goreleaser output, `upload-assets: true`). The generator is referenced by **tag, not SHA** — slsa-verifier resolves builder identity from the tag and the generator refuses an unexpected ref; a comment records this as a deliberate exemption from the `P4-SEC-05` SHA-pin convention so a future pin sweep does not break it.
- `RELEASING.md`: new "Verifying build provenance (SLSA)" section with the `gh release download` + `slsa-verifier verify-artifact` recipe and one line on what a passing check proves (artifact built by this repo's release workflow at that tag, signed keyless with the Fulcio identity in Rekor).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P4-SEC-05` and `P4-QUAL-05` annotated — SLSA v1 build provenance shipped in this PR, pending live-release verification; both rows STAY open (P4-SEC-05 remainder: Apple Developer ID + notarization — cosign signing + SBOMs shipped in PR #115; P4-QUAL-05 remainder: live-release verification only). Open counts unchanged. *(Corrected post-merge: the original text predated the rebase onto #115 — CodeRabbit finding on PR #117.)*
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: the release/signing backlog row records SLSA provenance as shipped.

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- Live-release verification of the attestation (run `slsa-verifier` against the next real release). Remaining under `P4-SEC-05`: Apple Developer ID + macOS notarization (cosign signing + SBOMs shipped in PR #115). *(Corrected post-merge — CodeRabbit finding on PR #117.)*

## 2026-07-05 — feat(release): cosign keyless signing + SBOMs in the release pipeline (P4-SEC-05 / P4-QUAL-05)

Changed:
- `.goreleaser.yaml`: new `sboms` stanza (`artifacts: archive`) generates an SPDX SBOM per archive; new `signs` stanza runs `cosign sign-blob --bundle=... checksums.txt --yes` in keyless mode, producing `checksums.txt.sigstore.json` — the signature transitively covers every artifact `checksums.txt` lists. The `release.footer` now points at the README verification steps.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: the `goreleaser` job gains `permissions: { contents: write, id-token: write }` (the OIDC token cosign exchanges for a short-lived Fulcio cert; no stored signing key) and two SHA-pinned install steps ahead of the GoReleaser step (`sigstore/cosign-installer@6f9f17788090df1f26f669e9d70d6ae9567deba6` / v4.1.2, `anchore/sbom-action/download-syft@e22c389904149dbc22b58101806040fa8d37a610` / v0.24.0), matching the repo's SHA+comment pin style.
- `README.md`: new "Verify a download" subsection under Install with the `cosign verify-blob` + `sha256sum -c` sequence.
- `RELEASING.md`: the post-release smoke checklist now verifies the cosign signature and SBOM release assets are present.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P4-SEC-05` and `P4-QUAL-05` narrowed (not moved to *Recently shipped* — SLSA provenance lands in a sibling PR, and `P4-SEC-05`'s Apple Developer ID + notarization scope stays open, deadline Homebrew's Gatekeeper-failing-cask cutoff 2026-09-01).
- `spec/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Distribution section gains a "Supply-chain verification" list item describing the keyless-signing + SBOM mechanism; renumbered the surrounding list.
- `spec/00_START_HERE.md`: `Last validated` bumped to 2026-07-05; the README bullet now notes the "Verify a download" subsection.
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: the "code signing/notarization" backlog row flipped `[ ]` → `[~]` with a shipped/remaining-scope note.

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (no Go source changed; kept green).

Follow-ups:
- SLSA build provenance (sibling PR, same finding IDs).
- Apple Developer ID signing + notarization for the macOS binary, ahead of Homebrew's 2026-09-01 Gatekeeper-failing-cask cutoff.

## 2026-07-05 — chore(community): Discussions + good-first-issues + AGENTS.md reframe (AD-8)

Changed:
- **Repo settings (recorded here, not in the tree):** GitHub Discussions enabled (`gh repo edit --enable-discussions`, verified via `has_discussions`); three curated starter issues seeded from the open backlog and labeled — #111 `P5-CLI-03` (`MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive` before the network clone, `good first issue`), #112 `P5-CLI-01` (render-seam rollout to remaining leaf commands, `good first issue`), #113 `P4-QUAL-07` residual (contextcheck + forge-chain context threading, `help wanted`). The default `good first issue`/`help wanted` labels were reused — no bespoke hyphenated label.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`: Discussions contact link ("Questions & ideas") between the security and spec links, so non-bug traffic routes off the issue tracker.
- `AGENTS.md`: AD-8 scope banner at the top — this file is the *maintainer's* agent workflow, not a contributor obligation; external contributors need only `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and fork-PR spec-drift/work-log bookkeeping is completed by the maintainer at merge (the gate's fork-advisory mode lands in the sibling AD-8 PR).
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: the AD-8 direction bullet marks the Discussions/labels and AGENTS.md-reframe goals SHIPPED 2026-07-05.

Validated:
- `gh api repos/Reederey87/DevStrap --jq .has_discussions` → `true`; issues #111–#113 visible with labels. `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- Remaining AD-8 tail after this wave: bus-factor (second write-access maintainer).

## 2026-07-05 — chore: v0.1.0 released — distribution ledger/backlog bookkeeping

Changed:
- **v0.1.0 is live** (release execution, recorded here; the shipped code landed in PRs #103–#109). Flow: `v0.1.0-rc.1` on `5b5728d` validated the pipeline (prerelease, 4 archives + checksums, completions in archives, installer smoke on darwin/arm64 incl. version normalization, NO tap commit under `skip_upload: auto`); the first stable attempt on the same commit then failed and exposed the two-tags-one-commit GoReleaser bug fixed in PR #108 (`GORELEASER_CURRENT_TAG` pin) — the broken tag was deleted and the release re-cut as `v0.1.0-rc.2` on `257b137` (post-#109 main) followed by `v0.1.0` on the SAME commit, live-verifying the fixed promotion path. Stable smoke all green: `brew install Reederey87/devstrap/devstrap` links the binary + bash/zsh/fish completions and `devstrap version` reports `0.1.0 (257b137…)`; the tap got exactly ONE cask commit; the no-override `curl|sh` installer resolves latest → v0.1.0 with checksum verification.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P4-PROD-05` moved to *Recently shipped* (full release-execution note incl. the live-caught same-commit bug); the Pass-4 open-table row is now a shipped stub pointer.
- `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: the Homebrew-tap backlog row flipped `[~]` → `[x]`; the AD-8 direction bullet records v0.1.0 as SHIPPED with the PR #108 hardening.

Validated:
- Release pipeline runs green for `v0.1.0-rc.2` and `v0.1.0`; the stable smoke checklist in `RELEASING.md` executed end-to-end on this Mac. `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (post-commit).

Follow-ups:
- Signing/notarization (`P4-SEC-05`/`P4-QUAL-05`) would let the cask drop the quarantine-strip hook (already tracked).

## 2026-07-05 — fix(agent): fail closed when the sandbox home anchor cannot resolve (PR #107 post-merge review)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/agent.go`: the sandbox spec construction moved into `agentSandboxSpec`, which now REFUSES the run when `os.UserHomeDir()` fails instead of silently passing an empty `UserHome` — with an empty anchor the generated Seatbelt profile dropped every home-anchored credential deny (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `.netrc`, …) while still reporting the run as sandboxed (CodeRabbit post-merge finding on PR #107). `--sandbox off` is the explicit escape hatch, and the error says so. Pinned by `TestAgentSandboxSpecFailsClosedWithoutUserHome` + `TestAgentSandboxSpecAnchorsRealUserHome`.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: escaped the literal pipes in the `P4-GIT-03` row's `--sandbox auto\|off\|require` code span — unescaped they split the markdown table row into 5 cells (CodeRabbit MD056). The other `auto|off|require` occurrences are prose, not tables, and stay as-is.
- `spec/10_AGENT_WORKSPACES_AND_POLICIES.md`: the sandbox paragraph states the fail-closed home-anchor contract.
- `spec/18_WORK_LOG.md` housekeeping (review): five historical blocks (2026-06-24/25/26) sat out of strict newest-first order — an old parallel-rebase artifact; blocks stable-reordered by date descending with same-day relative order preserved, content untouched.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./internal/cli/`; full `-race` suite; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (post-commit).

Follow-ups:
- None

## 2026-07-05 — fix(release): pin GORELEASER_CURRENT_TAG so the rc → stable flow survives two tags on one commit

Changed:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: the GoReleaser step now sets `GORELEASER_CURRENT_TAG: ${{ github.ref_name }}`. Found live on the first `v0.1.0` attempt: the documented rc → stable flow tags the SAME commit twice (`v0.1.0-rc.1` validated `5b5728d`, then `v0.1.0` was pushed on it), and without the pin GoReleaser derives the current tag from `git tag --points-at HEAD`, where git's version sort ranks `v0.1.0-rc.1` ABOVE `v0.1.0` — the stable run therefore rebuilt `0.1.0-rc.1` artifacts and failed uploading them onto the existing rc release (`422 already_exists` × 5; the rc release was left intact, and no `v0.1.0` release object was created). The rc run itself could never catch this, since the ambiguity only exists once the second tag lands. The broken `v0.1.0` tag must be deleted and re-cut on a commit CONTAINING this fix — the workflow executes from the tag's own tree, so a re-run of the old tag reproduces the failure.
- `RELEASING.md`: the promote-to-stable step now documents that the stable tag may share the rc's commit and why the pin makes that safe.
- `spec/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`: the Distribution section records the `GORELEASER_CURRENT_TAG` pin; the folder-carrier paragraph now states the shipped per-operation root revalidation contract instead of the pre-review "resolved once" wording (the PR #106 CodeRabbit thread — the sentence predated the review-round fix that made revalidation use-time).

Validated:
- Failure mode reproduced from the run 28738481083 logs (rc-named artifacts + `already_exists` against the rc release id). `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (post-commit). The real proof is the re-cut `v0.1.0` tag publishing correctly, recorded in the release smoke.

Follow-ups:
- None (the re-tag itself is release execution, not repo content).

## 2026-07-05 — feat(agent): macOS Seatbelt sandbox for agent run (P4-GIT-03 slice 1)

Changed:
- `internal/platform`: new `Sandbox` adapter seam on `Set` (`sandbox.go` — `SandboxSpec`, `Sandbox` interface, `UnsupportedSandbox`), a build-tag-free SBPL profile generator (`sandbox_profile.go` — pure `sbplProfile(spec)`, unit-testable on every platform), and the darwin `SeatbeltSandbox` (`sandbox_darwin.go`): writes a 0600 profile into the run's log dir and prepends `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -f <profile>` to the argv. Profile shape is allow-default with targeted denies (the pattern Claude Code/Codex CLI/VT Code converged on — deny-default breaks arbitrary toolchains): global write deny re-allowing worktree/tmp dirs + device nodes (LogDir is profile placement only — the log is parent-written, so the child cannot tamper with its own 0600 log or profile); credential-read denies (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.kube`, `~/.docker`, `~/.devstrap/keys`) anchored on the REAL user home (child `$HOME` is repointed to the worktree, but the dotfiles are still on disk); `(deny network*)` when requested. All spec paths are `EvalSymlinks`-resolved first — Seatbelt matches kernel-real paths and `/tmp`/`TMPDIR` are symlinks on macOS.
- `internal/cli/agent.go`: `--sandbox auto|off|require` on `agent run` (env `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX`, default `auto`), resolved via `resolveAgentSandbox` BEFORE the store/worktree exist so `require`-on-unsupported fails with the policy exit class and no orphan cleanup path. Policy map: `readonly`/`cautious` → network denied; `guarded`/`ephemeral-ci` → network open; `yolo-local` → unconfined (conflicts with `require`, config error). `auto` + unavailable prints one warning ("agent policy remains advisory (AGEN-01)") and runs as before — Linux behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged. The advisory argv/file policies still run in addition (better pre-spawn errors; only layer on Linux). Test seam `sandboxBackend` mirrors init.go's `keychainBackend`.
- Known risk (accepted): Seatbelt can break Apple-signed helpers spawned by user commands; `--sandbox off` and `yolo-local` are the escape hatches, and `sandbox-exec` deprecation is tracked in the adapter comment (if Apple removes it, `Available()` fails and `auto` degrades loudly instead of breaking runs).
- Out of scope (named follow-up slices in spec/14): Linux bubblewrap/landlock/seccomp, `sandbox.violation` telemetry, tighter read confinement.
- Specs: spec/10 enforcement-reality + implementation paragraphs, spec/13 agent-run contract (+ future-work line), spec/14 XL-items + backlog checkbox, spec/15 threat-model reality + release-gate lines, spec/16 test rows; ledger `P4-GIT-03` → partial.

Validated:
- `gofmt`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- Kernel enforcement proven on this Mac: `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E=1 go test ./internal/platform/ -run TestSeatbeltSandboxEnforcement` — outside-worktree write BLOCKED, `~/.ssh` read BLOCKED, confined write + non-sensitive read allowed. Plus a live `devstrap agent run` smoke on a real repo (sandboxed cat of `~/.ssh` fails; `--sandbox off` succeeds).

- Post-review (dual: Codex adversarial + opus): (P1 accepted) the write allow-list granted the machine-wide shared `$TMPDIR` — the child now gets a PER-RUN scratch dir (`$TMPDIR/devstrap-agent-<runID>`, created 0700, removed after the run) with its `TMPDIR` env repointed to match, so the kernel grant is scoped to the run; (P1 rejected as stale) the same finding named the log dir as child-writable and the `git_test.go` "revert" — the log dir was already parent-only in the reviewed HEAD, and the git_test delta was the stale-base diff view resolved by the pre-push rebase; (P2 accepted) `DEVSTRAP_SANDBOX_E2E=1` is now set in ci.yml's test job so the kernel-enforcement test actually runs on macos-latest; (P3 accepted) home-root credential FILES (`.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.gitconfig`) joined the read-deny set, aligning with the wrapper's own sensitive-token scanner (AGEN-05); (P3 accepted) spec/15 now documents the `(deny network*)` residual — XPC/`mach-lookup` and unix-domain sockets are not covered by an allow-default profile, so the network deny is best-effort against deliberate evasion; (P3 accepted) stale "log dir" mention dropped from the profile header comment.

Follow-ups:
- Linux sandbox slice (bubblewrap/landlock/seccomp) and `sandbox.violation` telemetry (spec/15 reserves the event name); `mach-lookup` tightening under DenyNetwork.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(hub): local-folder / cloud-drive-folder carrier completes AD-1

Changed:
- `internal/hub/folder.go` (new): `FolderHub`, the `folder:<abs-path>` hub carrier. It composes the proven `R2Hub` semantics over the existing `fsObjectStore` rooted DIRECTLY in the shared folder — a cloud drive or network mount is the replication transport, so there is NO fetch/commit/push loop (unlike the git carrier). Every `dssync.Hub` method is `acquire cross-process lock → delegate to R2Hub → release`. `GetSweepLock` mirrors the git carrier's observation-floor down-clamp so a future-dated sidecar cannot wedge the stale-break. `NewFolderHub(dir, workspaceID, cacheRoot)` requires a non-empty ws + absolute dir, rejects an existing file, `MkdirAll(0700)`s a missing folder, and `EvalSymlinks` the root once (cloud-drive roots are often symlinks); the per-device lock + observation floor live under `cacheRoot/<16-hex sha256 of the resolved dir>/` (mirroring the git carrier's `hub-git/<hash>/` layout), NEVER inside the shared folder — replicating lock churn would cause false contention and conflicted copies.
- Design rationale (lock/observed placement): only ciphertext object payloads and their RFC3339Nano timestamp sidecars live in the shared folder (they must replicate to converge); the lock file and `observed.json` are inherently per-device local state and stay in the home cache. Cross-DEVICE conditional writes (retention/sweep-lock CAS) are best-effort by nature — a cloud drive has no cross-writer linearization point (no atomic push-ref, no conditional PUT), so the lock only serializes SAME-machine processes; two devices writing simultaneously can each win (the drive surfaces a conflicted copy). Documented as the same advisory-cooperation residual class as the sweep lock's byzantine residuals.
- `internal/hub/gitcarrier.go`: extracted the cross-process lock (in-process mutex + O_EXCL lock file + heartbeat goroutine + stale-TTL break) into a shared package-local `fsLock` struct (in `folder.go`) used by BOTH carriers; `GitCarrierHub.lock` now delegates to it. Pure refactor — the git carrier's fields, timing, and behavior are unchanged. The three lock-timing consts were renamed `gitLock*` → `fsLock*` to reflect the now-shared helper (values identical); the two `gitLockStale` references in `gitcarrier_adversarial_test.go` were updated to `fsLockStale`. All existing gitcarrier tests pass unchanged in behavior.
- `internal/cli/hub.go`: `selectBackendHub` gained a `folder:` case (BEFORE the git case; requires an initialized workspace like r2/git; hub id `folder:<workspace_id>`; cache root `~/.devstrap/hub-folder`), `hubConfigured` gained the parity case, both `unrecognized hub` error strings now name `folder:<abs-path>`, and a new pure `parseFolderURI` helper rejects relative/empty paths and embedded `?`-params. `hub init` was NOT extended — it remains git-only by spec contract.
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: `isRemoteHubID` now classifies `folder:` as a remote (workspace-id-keyed) hub, so a joiner's workspace-id-mismatch warning fires for folder carriers like it does for r2/s3/git.
- Tests: `internal/hub/folder_test.go` (`TestFolderHubConformance` reusing `assertHubRoundTrip`/ack/retention-snapshot/sweep-lock helpers; constructor rejections; symlinked-root resolution; cross-process-lock CAS one-winner mirroring `TestGitCarrierRetentionCASOneWinner`; sweep-lock one-holder; two-device convergence + compaction), `internal/cli/hub_folder_test.go` (`parseFolderURI`/`hubConfigured` parity), a `folder:` row pair in `TestShouldWarnWorkspaceIDMismatch`, and `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/sync_folder_hub.txtar` (two device homes sharing one folder hub via `DEVSTRAP_HUB`, founder init+add+sync then joiner init --join + enroll/approve + sync/materialize).
- Specs: `spec/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` (folder-carrier design + the "Remaining AD-1 slices" sentence retired), `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` (scheme inventory), `spec/01_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md` + `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md` (AD-1 now COMPLETE), `spec/15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md` (best-effort cross-device CAS note), `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md` (new test rows).
- `docs/audits/README.md` unchanged: AD-1 is a `spec/14` direction item, not a ledger finding, so the open/shipped counts are unaffected.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (P2 accepted) `FolderHub.guard` now runs a **use-time root revalidation** after taking the lock — `EvalSymlinks(root)` must still equal the construction-time resolution, else the operation is refused — because `safePath` only Lstats components BELOW the root, so a shared/replicated root later swapped for a symlink (a folder-specific exposure; the git carrier's root is a private clone) would otherwise redirect every read/write outside the registered folder; pinned by `TestFolderHubRefusesReplacedRoot` (write refused, nothing lands outside, read refused) and stated in `spec/15`. (P3 accepted) `TestFolderHubWorkspacesAreIsolated` pins the two-workspace/one-folder case: isolation rides the `workspaces/<workspace_id>/` key prefix, and neither workspace sees the other's events. Codex additionally verified the `fsLock` extraction behavior-preserving (O_EXCL/heartbeat/release ordering/mutex-by-pointer), full 21-method guard coverage, cache-vs-shared placement, and CLI dispatch ordering, with no findings.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (all packages ok); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- `fsObjectStore.PutObject` still writes with a plain `WriteFile` rather than temp+rename. A same-dir temp+rename would keep a cloud-drive uploader from ever observing a torn object mid-write, but it risks the git carrier staging a stray temp file (`git add -A`) if a crash lands between write and rename, so it was deliberately skipped this cycle to keep the carriers' shared store regression-free. Revisit as an isolated hardening pass (folder-only, or a temp path excluded from git staging).

## 2026-07-05 — feat(dist): Homebrew cask + curl|sh installer + completions packaging (AD-8 / P4-PROD-05)

Changed:
- `.goreleaser.yaml`: `before` hooks pre-generate bash/zsh/fish completions (`go run ./cmd/devstrap completion <shell>` — stateless); archives now ship LICENSE + README + completions; new `homebrew_casks` block publishing to `Reederey87/homebrew-devstrap` (`Casks/devstrap.rb`) on stable tags only (`skip_upload: auto`). Cask, not formula: `brews:` is deprecated since GoReleaser v2.16 and casks now cover Linux. Because the binaries are unsigned (cosign/SLSA tracked under `P4-SEC-05`/`P4-QUAL-05`), the cask strips the quarantine bit via the documented post-install hook.
- `scripts/install.sh` (new): POSIX `curl|sh` installer — os/arch detect, latest-release resolution via the releases/latest redirect (no API token), `DEVSTRAP_VERSION`/`DEVSTRAP_INSTALL_DIR` overrides, sha256 verification against `checksums.txt` BEFORE extraction (hard-fails if no sha tool exists), `/usr/local/bin` → `~/.local/bin` fallback with a PATH note, never sudo.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: passes `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` (fine-grained PAT scoped to the tap repo only) into the goreleaser step; the verify-job gate is unchanged.
- `internal/specdrift`: `.goreleaser.yaml` and `scripts/**` now require a work-log entry (they were neither spec-tracked nor work-log-gated — a silent coverage gap); pinned by `TestReleaseTierFilesRequireWorkLog`; `spec/03` `tracks_code` picks both up.
- `README.md` §Install reordered: brew → curl|sh → release binary → source; roadmap note removed. `RELEASING.md`: tap/PAT prerequisites + post-release smoke checklist. `spec/03` gains a Distribution section; `spec/14` release-gates bullet, AD-8 direction, and Homebrew-tap backlog row updated; ledger `P4-PROD-05` marked partial (closes when `v0.1.0` actually publishes).

Validated:
- `gofmt`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- `goreleaser check` + `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean` (via `go run github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@latest`): archives contain the binary + 3 completions; `Casks/devstrap.rb` renders with the quarantine postflight and completion stanzas; no deprecation warnings.
- `sh -n scripts/install.sh`; installer smoke against the snapshot artifacts: positive install, corrupted-artifact rejection, and missing-checksums-entry rejection.
- Post-review (Codex, dual-review): (2x P1 accepted) the checksum pipeline `grep … | sha256sum -c -` could read as verified on a MISSING checksums entry (empty stdin); the matching line is now extracted first and its absence is a hard `fail` before any hash tool runs — pinned by the missing-entry smoke case; (P3 accepted) stray `.,` in the spec/14 release-gates bullet; (opus reviewer, no P1/P2, P3 accepted) an unprefixed `DEVSTRAP_VERSION=0.1.0` now normalizes to `v0.1.0` instead of 404ing — and the opus pass empirically confirmed the checksum P1 mattered on macOS too: this machine's `/sbin/sha256sum` exits 0 on empty stdin (fails open), so the grep-first hard-fail is load-bearing on every platform.

Follow-ups:
- Cut `v0.1.0-rc.1` → smoke → `v0.1.0` (maintainer-gated; the tap repo + `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret must exist first — see `RELEASING.md`). Flip the ledger row and the `[~]` backlog row when the stable tag lands.
- Signing/notarization (`P4-SEC-05`/`P4-QUAL-05`) would let the cask drop the quarantine-strip hook.

## 2026-07-05 — feat(cli): ssh-add remedy hint on auth-class exits

Changed:
- `internal/cli/root.go`: `ExitCodeWithWriter` prints a second stderr line for every auth-class failure — `hint: git authentication failed — check ssh key / repo access (load your key: ssh-add ~/.ssh/<key>)` — closing the polish follow-up recorded in the 2026-07-04 entries (the §F.2 live dogfood hit exit 6 quoting "ERROR: Repository not found." with no remedy). Placement is load-bearing: the hint check runs BEFORE the `appError` early return, so an auth error wrapped in an app exit code keeps its code but still gets the hint (`errors.Is` traverses `appError.Unwrap`). Wording mirrors the `hub init` probe warning so the two surfaces stay consistent. Auth class only — network/timeout/branch classes stay hint-free.
- `internal/cli/root_test.go`: `TestAuthErrorsPrintSSHAddRemedyHint` pins bare `ErrAuth`, the production `CommandError{Kind: ErrAuth}` shape, the `appError`-wrapped case (wrapped code wins, hint still prints), and the no-hint negative for `ErrNetwork`.
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md`: the backend-selection paragraph now states the shipped stderr contract instead of "recorded polish follow-up".
- `docs/audits/README.md` unchanged (work-log follow-up; no audit finding).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./internal/cli/`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (post-commit).

Follow-ups:
- None

## 2026-07-05 — test(git): load-robust margins for the terminal-timeout tests

Changed:
- `internal/git/git_test.go`: `TestCloneTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetryOrWipe` flaked twice under full-suite `go test -race ./...` load (passes in isolation and CI), and a delegated verification run reproduced it on an UNCHANGED tree with a second failure mode — the 500ms transfer deadline killed the fake git before its `echo attempt` marker ever ran (`open …/count: no such file or directory`). Two robustness fixes across the family (`TestCloneTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetryOrWipe`, `TestFetchTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetry`, `TestLFSPullTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetry`, `TestPushBranchTimeoutIsTerminalWithHint`): the fakes now `exec sleep 5` against the 500ms deadline (10x margin instead of 2x; a killed child still returns at the deadline, so tests are not slower), and `attemptCount` treats a missing marker file as zero with the assertions relaxed from `== 1` to `<= 1` — the pinned property is "a terminal timeout never RETRIES (and never wipes the destination)", which a pre-echo kill satisfies. The inverse test (`TestCloneUsesLongTimeoutInsteadOfShortTimeout`) raises `LongTimeout` 2s→30s so machine load cannot stretch the 0.2s success path past the deadline and flip its premise.
- Assessed and rejected: exposing `exec.Cmd`'s hardcoded 10s `WaitDelay` (`internal/git/git.go`) as a `Runner` knob — irrelevant to this flake, since `exec sleep` leaves no grandchild holding the output pipe.
- `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md`: the `P6-GIT-01` row now states the at-most-one-attempt form and the load-robust margins.
- `docs/audits/README.md` unchanged (test housekeeping; no audit finding).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race -count=20 ./internal/git/`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (post-commit).

Follow-ups:
- None

## 2026-07-04 — fix(hub): userinfo-strip the echoed hub value in hub init's conflict error (review P3)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/hub.go`: the `hub init` conflict refusal wraps the EXISTING config value in `redact.URL` before echoing — a hand-edited credentialed `hub:` value no longer depends on the outer output scrub to stay out of the error text (defense in depth; the new argument is already credential-rejected before this point).
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md`: the `hub init` section now states the echoed existing value is userinfo-stripped and that the same-value no-op skips the reachability probe (behavior unchanged; the sentence previously implied the probe always ran).
- Review context: PR #101's independent review (no P1/P2) landed these two P3/nit items after auto-merge fired on green CI; skipped with rationale — `--quiet` suppressing the "Configured hub:" line (consistent with the P6-CLI-04 resolution routing sibling hub summaries through `progressf`) and the `DEVSTRAP_HUB` env value participating in current-hub detection (low impact, semantics shared with every hub consumer).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal`; `go build ./...`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli -count=1`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

## 2026-07-04 — feat(hub): devstrap hub init <git-url> writes the carrier hub into config (AD-1 slice)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/hub.go`: added `devstrap hub init <git-url>` with `--force` and `--no-probe`, wired under `devstrap hub`. The command requires an initialized home (`config.yaml` present), accepts only the existing git-carrier URI forms via `parseGitCarrierURI`, rejects credentialed URIs without echoing the secret-bearing value, refuses non-git hubs with the manual `hub:` config message, detects existing different `hub:` values as `exit-conflict`, and treats same-value reruns as no-op success. After writing, it runs a best-effort sanitized `git ls-remote` probe unless `--no-probe`; probe failure is a warning with the `ssh-add`/repo-access remedy, never a refusal.
- `internal/cli/init.go`: added `rewriteConfigHub`, modeled on `rewriteConfigRoot`, to replace or append exactly one top-level `hub:` line while preserving every other line/comment and writing through the existing `0600` atomic config writer.
- Tests: new `internal/cli/hub_init_test.go` covers config rewriting, uninitialized-home usage refusal, same-URL no-op, conflict/force overwrite behavior, credential redaction, r2/s3 manual-config refusal, and `--no-probe` skipping the git runner (via a PATH-shadowing fake git). `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/sync_git_hub.txtar` now uses `devstrap hub init git+file://...` before `devstrap sync` to prove the bootstrap path converges.
- Docs: `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` command inventory and new `### hub init` section, `spec/00` command inventory, README command table, and the `spec/14` AD-1 checkbox flipped. `docs/audits/README.md` intentionally unchanged.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` including the new `hub_init` unit tests and the updated `sync_git_hub` two-device e2e.
- Implemented by gpt-5.5 (codex) from a written spec with acceptance criteria; diff transplanted onto a fresh `origin/main` worktree (base had moved under the job as items 1–3 of the AD-1 wave merged) and line-by-line reviewed.

Follow-ups:
- Remaining AD-1 slice: local-folder / cloud-drive-folder carrier (plus the partial-clone cache optimization noted in the carrier entry).

## 2026-07-04 — docs(quickstart): git carrier is the documented default hub; r2:// demoted to scale-up (AD-1 swap)

Changed:
- `README.md`: quickstart step 6 now teaches the zero-infrastructure git carrier first (create an
  empty private repo, set `hub: "git@github.com:you/devstrap-hub.git"`, `devstrap sync` — no bucket,
  no token plane, no `hub login`) with the operational caveats (run `hub compact` periodically —
  deleting files never shrinks a git repo; GitHub hard limits: 100 MB/object, ~2 GiB/push); the R2/S3
  block moved to a new "Scaling up: S3-compatible hubs (R2/S3)" subsection; the pair-a-second-device
  runbook generalizes "R2/S3 hub" → "remote hubs", uses the git-carrier config line, and demotes both
  `hub login` steps to one R2/S3-only parenthetical (keeping the keychain-ordering trap); feature
  bullet, alpha status note, and the `sync` command-reference row lead with the carrier.
- `internal/cli/init.go` (hint strings only, no behavior): all three next-step hints teach
  `set 'hub: git@github.com:<you>/<hub-repo>.git' (any private repo; or r2://<bucket>)`; the bare
  `--join` warning and the copy-id recovery hint say "remote hubs (git carrier, r2/s3)" / "remote
  hubs only" instead of "r2/s3 hubs".
- `spec/13`: command inventory, init-hint paragraph (verbatim-matched to the new strings, P6-CLI-05
  note extended with the AD-1 swap), sync examples/options reordered git-first, backend-selection
  paragraph leads with the carrier, `hub login` marked R2/S3-only. Also corrected an inaccurate
  claim: no `ssh-add` remedy hint is emitted on auth failures (none exists in code — confirmed by
  the §F.2 live dogfood); recorded as a polish follow-up instead.
- `spec/19`: header callout flips "remaining AD-1 slice" → shipped (with the forge object-limit
  caveat); §E.1/§E.3 teach the carrier config and mark `hub login` R2/S3-only.
- `spec/14` AD-1 row: dogfood + quickstart-default-swap slices flipped to `[x]` (2026-07-04);
  `spec/00` (current position + product-promise sync comment) and `spec/02` (AD-1 success-metric
  status) updated to match. `docs/audits/README.md` unchanged (AD-1 is a spec/14 direction item).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `golangci-lint run`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`;
  `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; manual `devstrap init` in a temp home to
  eyeball all three new hint forms.

Follow-ups:
- Remaining AD-1 slices (spec/14): `devstrap hub init <git-url>` bootstrap (in flight), local-folder /
  cloud-drive-folder carrier, partial-clone cache optimization.
- Polish: emit an `ssh-add`/access remedy hint for auth-class git-carrier failures (spec/13 no longer
  overclaims it).

## 2026-07-04 — fix(doctor): probe git-carrier hubs in the --remote workspace-id check

Changed:
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: treat `git:<workspace-id>` hub ids as remote workspace-id-keyed hubs for the joiner workspace-id mismatch heuristic (`isRemoteHubID` now matches `git:` alongside `r2:`/`s3:`), and update the nearby comments to name the r2/s3/git set. The gap was observed live in the git-carrier dogfood (`spec/19` §F.2 step 8): `doctor --remote` on a git-carrier device reported reachability but silently skipped the joiner "never pulled / workspace id match" probe. `GitCarrierHub` keys objects by workspace id exactly like R2 and implements `HasEvents`, so the heuristic applies unchanged.
- `internal/cli/doctor_test.go`: add git-carrier table coverage for the warning path plus founder and advanced-cursor non-warning cases.
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md`: document that the `workspace id match` warning applies to R2/S3 and the git carrier.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- `go test ./internal/cli -run 'ShouldWarn|CheckHubHealth' -count=1`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- Implemented by gpt-5.5 (codex) from a line-level spec; diff transplanted onto a fresh `origin/main` worktree and line-by-line reviewed.

Follow-ups:
- None

## 2026-07-04 — docs(hub): live git-carrier GitHub dogfood — two-device sync + compact + snapshot bootstrap PASS (spec/19 §F.2)

Changed:
- `spec/19_CLOUD_PROVISIONING_GUIDE.md`: §F retitled "Live dogfood validation log" (covers all hub
  backends; git-carrier runs need no creds file) and a new **§F.2** records the first live exercise of
  the AD-1 git carrier against a real private GitHub repo: three simulated devices, 8 real (mostly
  private) project repos, one-paste pairing with `--fingerprint`, a deliberate concurrent two-device
  push race (both landed via the non-FF refetch-and-reapply loop), ciphertext-only carrier contents
  confirmed by plain `git clone` + grep, clean 1s non-interactive auth failure (exit `exitAuth`),
  `hub compact` bounding remote history 18 commits → 2 (parentless squash root + sweep-unlock),
  fresh-device snapshot bootstrap ("Recovering from hub snapshot…", materialized 8/8), `hub gc` clean,
  `doctor --remote` 25 ok / 0 errors, and the env-gated `TestGitCarrierRealRemoteConformance` PASS
  against a second disposable GitHub repo. No `hub login`, no bucket, no creds file — the
  zero-infrastructure claim held end-to-end.
- No code changes; `docs/audits/README.md` unchanged (AD-1 is a spec/14 direction item; ledger counts
  unaffected).

Validated:
- The live run itself (all outputs quoted in §F.2), driven through a fresh `origin/main` build of
  `cmd/devstrap` with per-device `--home`/`--root` + `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1`.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- `doctor --remote` skips the `workspace id match`/`HasEvents` probe for `git:` hub ids
  (`isRemoteHubID` in `internal/cli/doctor.go` matches only `r2:`/`s3:`) — observed live in §F.2
  step 8; fix in flight.
- Quickstart-default swap is now dogfood-unblocked (the git carrier is forge-proven); then
  `devstrap hub init <git-url>` bootstrap and the folder carrier (spec/14 AD-1 slices).
- Polish: auth-class carrier failures (e.g. "Repository not found") print no `ssh-add`/access remedy
  hint; consider extending the git error remedy mapping for the carrier fetch path.

## 2026-07-04 — feat(hub): zero-infrastructure private-git-repo carrier (AD-1 first slice)

Changed:
- `internal/hub/gitcarrier.go` (new): `GitCarrierHub` implements `dssync.Hub` over a private git repository — `hub: git+ssh://…` syncs through any repo the user can already push to (no bucket, no new credential plane). Architecture: rather than re-implementing the 24-method contract, it composes the proven `R2Hub` keying/semantics over a plain-filesystem `S3Client` (`fsObjectStore`) rooted in a local clone (`~/.devstrap/hub-git/<hash>/repo`), adding only the git transport — reads fetch + hard-reset to the remote head; writes apply idempotent file mutations (all keys content-addressed or `(device,seq)`-unique, so devices never touch the same path and no `git merge` ever runs), commit once per batch, push; the atomic push-ref CAS replaces S3 conditional PUT, a non-fast-forward rejection refetches and re-applies with capped backoff, and the conditional-put outcomes (`ErrSweepLockHeld`, `ErrRetentionConflict`) re-evaluate against the race winner's state. Object `LastModified` (gc grace, sweep TTL) rides RFC3339Nano sidecars under `.devstrap-meta/times/` (outside every listing prefix; commit times neither survive squashes nor register dedup re-puts). `CompactEventsBelow` deletes cold events then rewrites the branch to a single parentless commit pushed `--force-with-lease` — the only thing that actually shrinks a git carrier; the host GCs the unreachable history. A `devstrap-hub.json` marker (version + workspace id) refuses non-hub repos and foreign workspaces. In-process mutex + cross-process lock file (outside the checkout) serialize the shared clone; `HasEvents` implements the doctor capability probe.
- `internal/git/git.go`: new `ErrNonFastForward` classification ("non-fast-forward", "fetch first", "stale info", "cannot lock ref", "[rejected]") — the write loop's retry signal; exported `SafeBranchName` for `?branch=` validation.
- `internal/cli/hub.go`: `selectBackendHub`/`hubConfigured` gain the git-carrier case (`isGitCarrierURI`/`parseGitCarrierURI`): accepted forms `git+ssh://`, `git+https://`, `git+file://` (tests), scp-like `git@host:path.git`, optional `?branch=` (validated), embedded URI passwords rejected; hub id `git:<workspace_id>`; cache root derived beside the key dir.
- Tests: `internal/hub/gitcarrier_smoke_test.go` (bootstrap/round-trip/dedup smoke); `internal/hub/gitcarrier_test.go` — `assertHubRoundTrip` generalized to `dssync.Hub` (one-line signature change in `r2_test.go`) and run against a hermetic local bare repo, plus ack-plane/retention-CAS/snapshot/sweep-lock contract mirrors, concurrent-push-both-land (the non-FF loop), one-CAS-winner and one-lock-holder races, compact-squash (`rev-list --count == 1`, stale clone recovers and pushes), foreign-repo marker refusal (content untouched), and an env-gated real-remote conformance run (`DEVSTRAP_HUB_GIT_TEST_REMOTE`); `internal/cli/hub_git_test.go` (URI accept/reject matrix + preflight); e2e `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/sync_git_hub.txtar` (two devices converge and materialize through `git+file://`).
- Specs: `spec/03` (Hub backends — the carrier design, canonical), `spec/01` (Alternative-F note: the merge-conflict objection doesn't apply — no merges by construction), `spec/02` (success-metric status), `spec/00` (current position/inventory), `spec/13` (config forms + auth remedy), `spec/14` (AD-1 row: first slice shipped; remaining slices enumerated), `spec/15` (git-carrier trust model: no new credential plane; host sees ciphertext + git metadata; self-reported sidecar times acceptable for the advisory lock), `spec/16` (git-carrier conformance section), `spec/19` (zero-infra quickstart recipe), `spec/17` (git-as-carrier prior art). `docs/audits/README.md` unchanged — AD-1 is a direction item tracked in `spec/14`, not a pass finding; ledger counts unaffected.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `golangci-lint run` (0 issues); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` including the new git-carrier conformance/race/compact suites and the `sync_git_hub` two-device e2e through the real binary.

Post-review (dual + adversarial, all fixed in-PR):
- (Codex P1) `git+https://<token>@host` — a token in the https USERNAME slot passed the password-only check and would persist into the carrier clone's `.git/config`; any https userinfo is now rejected, and the rejection error no longer echoes the URI (`url.Redacted` masks only passwords). Pinned by the `https token as username` case (leak-checked).
- (Codex P2) `hub migrate-events --dry-run` entered the write loop and could seed the marker/branch on an empty carrier; dry-run now rides the read path. Pinned by `TestGitCarrierDryRunMigrateWritesNothing` (`ls-remote` stays empty).
- (Adversarial HIGH) writer-clock sidecars drove destructive age decisions — a days-slow writer's fresh blob could look past another device's gc grace window and be deleted before its referencing event landed; a future-dated dead holder's sweep lock was unbreakable. Fix: per-clone observation floor (`observed.json` beside the clone; blob times floored UP at first-seen-by-this-reader, sweep-lock time clamped DOWN to it). Pinned by `TestGitCarrierSkewedOldSidecarCannotAgeABlob` / `TestGitCarrierFutureSweepLockIsBreakableAfterObservedTTL` (both via real remote-side sidecar tampering).
- (Adversarial HIGH) the 30m age-only lock break could steal the shared clone from a live holder blocked in a long fetch; the lock file is now heartbeated (1m) while held with a 10m stale window, so the breaker fires only on dead holders. Pinned by `TestGitCarrierLiveLockIsNotStolenAndDeadLockIs`.
- The adversarial pass could NOT construct a double-granted sweep lock, a double-succeeding retention CAS, or a compaction schedule that permanently loses a concurrent device's events — the push-ref CAS + refetch-reapply claims held.
- (opus M1) a hostile carrier tree committing a symlink (e.g. `workspaces -> /etc`) survives `reset --hard` and object I/O would follow it outside the checkout — `safePath` now Lstat-walks every key component (and the marker) and refuses symlinks; pinned by `TestGitCarrierRefusesSymlinkedCarrierPaths` (read + write refused, outside dir untouched). (opus M2) carrier transport now rides the shared transient-network retry: `Runner.Fetch` on refresh, `PushBranch` (long-transfer deadline) on push, and both retry loops also treat `ErrNetwork` as refetch-and-reapply (safe: idempotent mutations + ref CAS). Accepted as documented nits: `[rejected]`-token breadth in the shared `classifyGitError` (no existing caller regresses — retry keys on `ErrNetwork`; stderr preserved), per-call `listKeys` walk (bounded by `hub compact`), and sidecar write amplification (the intended freshness propagation mechanism).

Follow-ups:
- Remaining AD-1 slices (spec/14): quickstart-default swap (README/`init` hints still teach `r2://` first), `devstrap hub init <git-url>` bootstrap, local-folder / cloud-drive-folder carrier, partial-clone cache optimization.
- Live dogfood against a real private GitHub repo (two-device simulation + `hub compact`), recorded spec/19-§F-style, before the quickstart-default swap.

## 2026-07-04 — fix(sync): reconcileSamePath winner is HLC-monotonic (P4-QUAL-02 follow-up)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/events.go`: `reconcileSamePath` now installs the **highest** `(HLC, deviceID, eventID)` coordinate as the same-path/different-remote winner (a one-line comparison flip: `samePathLess(current, next)`), the same rule as same-remote LWW (`decideUpsert`) and snapshot import (`importEntryTx`). The previous lowest-coordinate winner was the odd one out and the root cause of both known order-dependence divergences: the active row's source HLC could sit BELOW a dropped rival's, so a delete gated on the installed winner's HLC — or a same-remote LWW lift racing the cross-remote reconcile — flipped the terminal state by delivery order. With the running-max invariant, delete/different-remote mixes and multi-event-per-remote mixes converge in every order. New doc comment states why highest is load-bearing.
- `internal/sync/decide.go`: the header's "KNOWN RESIDUAL" paragraph replaced with the HLC-monotonic rule (nothing about the Decide seam remains order-dependent).
- `internal/sync/decide_rapid_test.go`: both witness tripwires (`TestDecideDifferentRemote{Delete,MultiEvent}DivergesWitness`) fired exactly as designed and were **deleted per their own failure-message protocol**; header updated; unused `state` import dropped.
- `internal/sync/property_helpers_test.go`: both generator exclusions removed — `genEventSet` now draws the full event space (per path: adds/updates/deletes freely over a 1-3 remote pool, so one remote can carry several HLCs and deletes mix with different-remote pairs); header rewritten to record the retired pattern.
- Winner-direction test updates (assertions invert to the higher coordinate; property/structure unchanged): `internal/sync/hlc_test.go` (`TestApplyEventsIsIdempotentAndDetectsRemoteConflict`, `TestReconcileSamePathIsCommutative`, `TestApplyEventsSamePathDifferentRemoteUsesCanonicalWinnerAcrossPullWindows`), `internal/sync/decide_property_test.go` (`work/conf` winner sanity + headers), `internal/cli/conflicts_test.go` (`--keep-remote` switches off the new gitlab@20 winner). The `apply_test.go` `conflict.resolved` fingerprint fixtures are literal-match only and needed no change.
- `spec/07_NAMESPACE_AND_SYNC_MODEL.md` (Decide-seam winner rule, model-check section marked fixed, §conflict-replay "lowest"→"highest"), `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md` (generator now exclusion-free; the tripwire pattern kept as methodology), `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` (`conflicts resolve` paragraph now names the interim installed winner: highest coordinate), `docs/audits/README.md` (P5-ARCH-01 + P4-QUAL-02 rows: residual/follow-up SHIPPED).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (pass; the widened generator drives the rapid convergence, import≡replay, and 3-replica model suites over the previously-excluded classes).
- Longer fuzz run over the widened space: `go test -run=^$ -fuzz=FuzzDecideConvergence -fuzztime=60s ./internal/sync/` (no crash).

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-04 — test(sync): property/model-check layer over the pure Decide seam (P4-QUAL-02)

Changed:
- `go.mod`/`go.sum`: adopt the test-only dependency `pgregory.net/rapid` v1.3.0 (zero transitive deps), per the P4-QUAL-02 audit ask (`P5-ARCH-01`→PR #87→here — the pure `Decide`/`Projection` seam is the foundation this builds on).
- `internal/sync/property_helpers_test.go`: the shared machinery — a convergent-event-set generator (`genEventSet`), a rapid-`T` store harness (`newSyncStoreRapid`; unenrolled local device, so the pre-enrollment window accepts the unsigned generated events exactly as the example apply tests do), a canonical active-projection encoder for cross-store equality (restricted to path/remote_key/source-coords/status; materialization + timestamps excluded because the event-apply and snapshot-import write paths legitimately differ there), and small draw helpers.
- `internal/sync/hlc_property_test.go`: rapid properties for the HLC via the injected `HLC.Now` seam — strict Send monotonicity under a backward-stepping clock, Receive non-regression, the EXACT `MaxSkew` accept/reject boundary, and logical-overflow carry.
- `internal/sync/decide_rapid_test.go`: the randomized convergence property (two independent permutations fold to one `Projection` + duplicate idempotency), the `FuzzDecideConvergence` `rapid.MakeFuzz` bridge, and the TWO witness tripwires (`TestDecideDifferentRemote{Delete,MultiEvent}DivergesWitness`).
- `internal/sync/import_replay_property_test.go`: import≡replay property (`BuildSnapshot`→`ImportSnapshot`+subset-replay ≡ full replay on active rows).
- `internal/sync/replica_model_test.go`: the 3-replica model check — independent orders split into sequential `ApplyEvents` batches converge byte-identically, with duplicate re-delivery and a tombstone-GC interleaving.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: a Linux-only 30s `go test -fuzz=FuzzDecideConvergence` smoke step after the race tests.
- `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md`: new "Property and model-check layer (P4-QUAL-02)" section (the properties, the rapid-dep decision, the generator-exclusion + witness-tripwire pattern, how to run the fuzz target).
- `docs/audits/README.md`: `P4-QUAL-02` moved from the Pass-4 open table to _Recently shipped_.

New finding (reported, out of scope to fix here):
- The 3-replica model check surfaced a genuine divergence BEYOND P5-ARCH-01's documented delete residual: same-path/different-remote convergence is order-dependent **with no delete involved** whenever one remote carries multiple events at different HLCs — same-remote LWW keeps that remote's HIGHEST HLC while cross-remote `reconcileSamePath` keeps the LOWEST coordinate, so the terminal winner flips by delivery order (deterministic witness: `rB@4, rB@1, rA@1` folds to `rA@1` in one order and `rB@4` in the reverse). Same lowest-coordinate root cause as the delete residual. `genEventSet` excludes both classes (pinned by the two witness tripwires that fail the day `reconcileSamePath` becomes LWW-consistent); the fix is a `reconcileSamePath` HLC-monotonic-winner follow-up.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean); `go build ./...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- `go test -race ./internal/sync/...` (pass) and the full `go test -race ./...`.
- Fuzz smoke: `go test -run=^$ -fuzz=FuzzDecideConvergence -fuzztime=10s ./internal/sync/` (no crash; 81k execs).

Follow-ups:
- Make `reconcileSamePath`'s different-remote winner HLC-monotonic (consistent with same-remote LWW); removing it retires both generator exclusions and their witness tests.
## 2026-07-04 — fix(agent): gate `agent pr` on run status + dead-PID sweep (P6-GIT-06)

Changed:
- `agent pr` now sweeps stale running agent rows, rejects non-`complete` runs with the same `exitConflict` class used by stale-base refusals, and supports `--allow-incomplete` as a warning-only override.
- Migration `00021_agent_run_runner_pid.sql` adds nullable `agent_runs.runner_pid`; new runs record `os.Getpid()`, store reads use `COALESCE(runner_pid, 0)`, and the CLI sweep flips dead-PID `running` rows to `interrupted` while leaving live and pre-migration NULL-PID rows alone.
- `agent list`, `agent show`, `agent pr`, and doctor run the sweep; doctor reports the reconciled and remaining-running counts. Specs 10/12/13 plus the audit ledger document the shipped behavior and schema version 21.
- Tests: failed-run PR refusal/override and deterministic dead/live/NULL runner-PID sweep coverage.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=$TMPDIR/gocache go test -race ./internal/cli/... ./internal/state/...`; `go build ./...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=$TMPDIR/gocache go test ./... -run 'TestEveryCommandIsDocumented|TestMigrationsDocumented'`.

Follow-ups:
- None for P6-GIT-06.
## 2026-07-04 — fix(scan): compile root .devstrapignore for scan pruning (P6-XP-06)

Changed:
- `internal/scan/scan.go`: `Options.Ignore` test-injection seam; `Walk` now compiles the scan root `.devstrapignore` once per walk via `ignore.CompileFromDir(cleanRoot, true)`, falls back to `ignore.DefaultMatcher()` with a warning on compile errors, prunes through the per-walk matcher and counts pruned directories into `Result.PrunedDirs`; the interactive `scan` prints the count as one informational line (NOT a warning — run-loop echoes scan warnings every tick, so routine default prunes would chatter forever; coordinator-adjusted during review). Compile failures remain warnings. Removed the package-level defaults-only prune matcher and `shouldPruneDir` shim.
- `internal/scan/scan_test.go`: default-prune table now calls `ignore.DefaultMatcher().ShouldPruneDir`; added scan-level `.devstrapignore` coverage for custom pruning plus defaults, malformed-file fallback to defaults, and `!bin/` re-inclusion.
- `spec/11_IGNORE_AND_LOCAL_GARBAGE.md`: P6-XP-06 marked shipped and scanner ignore behavior reconciled.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: P6-XP-06 moved to Recently shipped; Pass 6 open count reconciled to 5.
- `spec/18_WORK_LOG.md`: this entry.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` — clean (no output).
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./internal/scan/... ./internal/ignore/... ./internal/cli/...` — PASS.
- `go build ./...` — blocked by sandboxed default Go cache (`operation not permitted` under `/Users/reederey/Library/Caches/go-build`); reran as `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go build ./...` — PASS.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` — blocked by the same sandboxed default Go cache; reran as `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` — PASS (`spec drift check passed: 20 specs, 5 changed files`).
## 2026-07-04 — P6-DOC-01 residual — path-anchor the command-doc gate

Changed:
- `internal/cli/command_doc_test.go`: rewrote the command collector to recurse through visible Cobra subcommands as full paths, including arbitrary depth (`draft snapshot create`), and assert every path appears contiguously in both `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` and `spec/00_START_HERE.md`.
- `spec/00` and `spec/13`: expanded the command inventories so slash-grouped subcommands now appear as literal full paths; the concrete `spec/00` gaps caught by the hardened gate were grouped `agent`, `conflicts`, `devices`, `env`, `hub`, and `worktree` paths plus `db restore`.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: moved `P6-DOC-01` from the Pass-6 open table to Recently shipped and reconciled the Pass-6 open count.

Validated:
- `GOCACHE=$TMPDIR/gocache go test ./internal/cli/... -run TestEveryCommandIsDocumented -v`
## 2026-07-04 — fix(cli): --quiet suppresses progress chatter (P6-CLI-04)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/root.go`: added the quiet-aware `options.progressf` helper and updated `--quiet` help text.
- `internal/cli/sync.go`, `internal/cli/materialize.go`, `internal/cli/init.go`, `internal/cli/run_loop.go`, `internal/cli/hub.go`, and `internal/cli/scan.go`: routed progress/action-summary lines through `opts.progressf` while leaving dry-run output, result rows, warnings, prompts, JSON output, and error signals visible.
- `internal/cli/root_test.go` and `internal/cli/materialize_test.go`: added table-driven command tests for quiet vs non-quiet output and unchanged side effects/JSON results.
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md`: marked `P6-CLI-04` resolved and reconciled the logging wording.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: moved `P6-CLI-04` to Recently shipped and reconciled the Pass 6 open count.

Validated:

## 2026-07-04 — P6-CLI-03: wire Cobra usage errors to exitUsage=10

Changed:
- `internal/cli/root.go`: root `SetFlagErrorFunc` now wraps Cobra flag-parse errors in `appError{code: exitUsage}`; new `usageArgs` wrapper classifies positional-arg validator failures as `exitUsage`; `ExitCodeWithWriter` has a narrow fallback for Cobra's top-level `unknown command "` error text.
- `internal/cli/*.go`: every leaf command using Cobra `ExactArgs`/`MinimumNArgs`/`MaximumNArgs`/`RangeArgs`/`NoArgs` now wraps that validator with `usageArgs`.
- `internal/cli/root_test.go`: added regression coverage for unknown flags, wrong arity, unknown top-level subcommands, plain generic errors, and existing `appError` precedence.
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` and `docs/audits/README.md`: marked P6-CLI-03 shipped and reconciled the Pass 6 open count. The unknown-subcommand case stays in `ExitCodeWithWriter` because Cobra resolves it in `Find()` before any `RunE`, `PersistentPreRunE`, or `Args` hook can wrap it.

Validated:
- `go build -o /tmp/ds-smoke ./cmd/devstrap`; before the fix, `/tmp/ds-smoke frobnicate`, `/tmp/ds-smoke --frobnicate`, and `/tmp/ds-smoke add` all printed the existing Cobra error text and exited `1`.
- `grep -rn "cobra\\.\\(ExactArgs\\|MinimumNArgs\\|MaximumNArgs\\|RangeArgs\\|NoArgs\\)" internal/cli/*.go` showed every match wrapped in `usageArgs(...)`.
- `gofmt -l cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=$TMPDIR/gocache go test -race ./internal/cli/...`
- `go build ./...`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` → 0 issues (one errcheck finding on the initial `progressf` body caught and fixed during review).

Follow-ups:
- None. Judgment-call sites `hub login`, `hub logout`, and `scan --adopt` were routed through `progressf` because they are single-line action summaries with durable side effects and normal exit-code/DB state signals.

Follow-ups:
- None

## 2026-07-04 — feat(hub): bounded fan-out for R2Hub.Push + blob pushes (P6-HUB-03)

Changed:
- `internal/hub/r2.go`: added `r2PushConcurrency=8`; `R2Hub.Push` now pre-validates every event Seq before network work, then uses bounded `errgroup` fan-out for marshal + conditional PUT, preserving 412 duplicate no-op handling and aggregate all-or-nothing error semantics.
- `internal/cli/sync.go`: added `blobPushConcurrency=8`; `pushReferencedBlobs` now uploads referenced content-addressed blobs with bounded unordered fan-out while preserving existing error messages.
- `internal/hub/r2_test.go`, `internal/cli/sync_test.go`: added concurrent push coverage for mid-batch failure propagation, 50-event landing, multi-blob success, and blob failure surfacing.
- `spec/03`, `spec/15`, `docs/audits/README.md`: marked `P6-HUB-03` shipped, removed stale HLC-wave guidance, documented why full-batch push watermark semantics make plain fan-out correct, and reconciled the Pass-6 ledger from 6 to 5 open.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` printed nothing.
- `go test -race ./internal/hub/... ./internal/cli/...` passed.
- `go build ./...` passed.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` passed after this work-log entry.

## 2026-07-04 — fix(sync): gate deletes against the live row's HLC — delete-vs-re-add now converges (P5-ARCH-01 residual)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/decide.go`: `decideDelete` gains the live-row gate the P5-ARCH-01 review surfaced as missing — an active row whose `SourceEventHLC` is STRICTLY above the delete's HLC is kept (the delete is stale), with importTombstoneTx's exact precedence (newer-add-wins → dirty `pending_delete_conflict` → tombstone). Deliberately a bare-HLC comparison, NOT `samePathLess`: the add side resolves add/delete ties by HLC alone in the tombstone's favor (`decideUpsert` blocks adds at `HLC <= tombstoneHLC`), and `importTombstoneTx` pins the same rule for snapshot import — a full-coordinate tie-break here would re-diverge replay from import on equal-HLC ties. Before the fix, `A@10` then `D@5` (across pull windows) converged deleted while `D@5` then `A@10` converged active — a real strong-eventual-consistency violation; it also made `snapshot_import.go`'s import≡replay header claim false (import already had the gate, replay didn't). Scope note rewritten (delete-vs-re-add is now HLC-symmetric, in the pure core's remit).
- `internal/sync/snapshot_import.go`: `importTombstoneTx`'s rationale comment now names `decideDelete` as the replay-side mirror.
- `internal/sync/decide_property_test.go`: new `TestDecideConvergesDeleteReaddMix` folds `Decide` over all 5! delivery orders of an add/delete/strictly-higher-re-add mix (`work/readd` A@2→D@4→A@6, plus the review's exact `work/late` A@10/D@5 pair) asserting one terminal projection + duplicate-delivery idempotency; the 8-event anchor set and its 8! test are unchanged.
- `internal/sync/apply_test.go`: new `TestApplyEventsStaleDeleteDoesNotDestroyNewerAdd` proves both pull-window orders converge on `active@10` through the REAL apply path (separate `ApplyEvents` calls, where the in-batch HLC sort cannot mask the divergence) that a DIRTY row with a strictly-newer add survives a stale delete with NO pending_delete_conflict (the gate precedes the dirty guard, matching import), and that an equal-HLC add+delete converges on deleted in both orders.
- `spec/07`: the Decide/Projection seam section documents the HLC-symmetric delete-vs-re-add rule; ledger `P5-ARCH-01` row marks the residual FIXED.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` clean; `go test -race ./internal/sync/...` green (new 120-permutation property + both new example tests + all existing apply/hlc/import tests unchanged); full `go test -race ./...` green.

Follow-ups:
- `P4-QUAL-02` (randomized property/model-check foundation) now covers this interaction class by construction — next in this wave.
- Review-surfaced (Codex, dual-review; verified pre-existing): a delete mixed with a same-path/DIFFERENT-remote pair can still diverge by delivery order — `reconcileSamePath` installs the deterministic lowest-coordinate winner, so the active row's HLC can sit below a dropped rival's and a delete between the two flips outcome with order (`A@2/R1, B@10/R2, D@5`: A,B,D → deleted@5; D,A,B → active@10/R2). Independent of this PR's gate (identical trace pre-fix); scope claims narrowed in decide.go/spec/07; the randomized `P4-QUAL-02` suite must include this class.

## 2026-07-04 — docs: Pass-6 audit doc status reconciliation (37/43 shipped markers + spec counts)

Changed:
- `docs/audits/AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-07-01_PASS6.md`: added "— SHIPPED <date> (<PR/branch>)" heading markers to the 30 findings that shipped since the pass landed but lacked one (matching the 7-marker precedent from PR #64); added a "Findings at a glance" status banner and an Executive-summary qualifier noting 37/43 shipped (all five P1s) while preserving the as-found historical prose/counts/roadmap table; `P6-DOC-01` gets a narrower "doc portion applied; test-hardening residual OPEN" suffix instead of a SHIPPED marker.
- `spec/00_START_HERE.md`, `spec/14_MVP_ROADMAP_AND_BACKLOG.md`: refreshed the stale "Pass-6 P2/P3 backlog (11 open)" count to "(6 open)" to match `docs/audits/README.md`'s live ledger.

Validated:
- Docs-only change; no code touched.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` passes.

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-04 — docs: live-R2 dogfood — compact + snapshot bootstrap PASS (spec/19 §F)

Changed:
- `spec/19`: new "§F. Live-R2 dogfood validation log" recording the 2026-07-04 compact/snapshot run — the first LIVE exercise of the snapshot-exchange wave (`hub compact` + fresh-device snapshot bootstrap) against the real R2 bucket.

Result (all PASS): three simulated devices on one Mac (per-device `--home`/`--root` + `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1`, creds from `~/.devstrap/dogfood-r2.env`). A founded + added 3 repos + synced (pushed 3, WCK epoch 1); B joined via the fingerprint-confirmed one-paste ceremony (`init --join --code --fingerprint` ↔ `devices enroll --code --approve --fingerprint`), was granted the WCK, materialized 3/3; churned to 6 repos, converged. **`hub compact` deleted 7 cold events and published a sealed snapshot** (`5f144f0efc44`, floors dev_A=7/dev_B=2) — event log bounded. **Fresh device C** (cursor 0 < floor) printed "Recovering from hub snapshot…", imported the snapshot, and materialized 6/6 despite the deleted events. Incumbents synced with no false recovery; `hub gc` clean; C `doctor --remote` 24 ok / 0 errors. This closes the "live two-machine R2 dogfood (wave close-out)" and "live-R2 dogfood of the snapshot-exchange wave" follow-ups tracked in earlier entries.

Validated:
- Observed live on the registered R2 bucket. Docs-only PR; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift` passes.

Follow-ups:
- The run's workspace prefix remains on the bucket for inspection. `boto3`/`aws` CLI absent on the host, so independent object-listing wasn't done — the `hub compact` "deleted 7 cold events / published snapshot" output + the fresh-device recovery are the validation.

## 2026-07-04 — docs: document the live-R2 dogfood credential convention (AGENTS.md)

Changed:
- `AGENTS.md`: new "Live-R2 dogfood credentials" section — live-R2 dogfood runs source their S3 credentials from a stable `0600`, never-committed `~/.devstrap/dogfood-r2.env` (the five `DEVSTRAP_HUB_S3_*` exports), so agents no longer re-ask how to provide creds when the file exists. Records the `source`-per-invocation requirement, `DEVSTRAP_HUB=r2://$BUCKET`, `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` per-device simulation, and `db migrate`-before-first-`sync`.
- `spec/00`: the `spec/19` document-map line points at the new AGENTS.md section.

Validated:
- Docs-only; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift` passes. No code change.

Follow-ups:
- None (the dogfood run itself + its field notes land in a separate spec/19 close-out).

## 2026-07-04 — feat(db): full backup/restore for the whole workspace secret set (P6-DATA-04)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/db_backup.go` (new): `devstrap db backup --full <out.tar>` captures `state.db` (`VACUUM INTO`, no exclusive lock on the live WAL) + the `blobs/<sha256>.age` files `AllBlobRefs` reports + key material + `config.yaml`, all `0600`. Key capture is custody-aware: file custody copies `KeyDir` (asserting the device age + signing basenames are present — a missing one is a hard error, symmetric with keychain custody); keychain custody escrows via `devicekeys.HybridStore.ExportForBackup` (device age + Ed25519 signing + every held WCK epoch from `HeldKeys` + hub S3 creds; a missing required key is a hard error naming it). `db restore <in.tar>` refuses a non-empty state dir without `--force`, validates the staged DB (`ValidateDBFile` = `quick_check`+`foreign_key_check`) BEFORE promoting, and swaps ONLY the captured targets in place (`swapBackupTarget`: move-aside `.bak-<pid>` + rename + rollback) so un-captured Home contents (`quarantine/`, `logs/`) survive. `sanitizeBackupEntry` is a zip-slip guard (rejects abs paths, any `..`, symlinks/non-regular entries, out-of-layout paths; `O_EXCL` extraction).
- `internal/cli/db.go`: `--full` flag on `backup`; new `restore` subcommand (render/appError-consistent).
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: new `checkDanglingBlobRefs` (every `AllBlobRefs` entry has an on-disk `blobs/<sha>.age`); the two `quick_check` remedies now point at `db backup --full`.
- `internal/devicekeys/devicekeys.go`: `ExportForBackup`. `internal/state/store.go`: `ValidateDBFile` exported.
- spec/12 disaster-recovery runbook (what `--full` captures, restore, operator duty to store the archive encrypted since it holds private keys, keychain-custody caveat); spec/13 documents `backup --full`/`restore` + the doctor check.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` clean; `go build ./...`; **full `go test ./...` green** (`-race` on cli/devicekeys/cmd). Round-trip test: `env capture → db backup --full → wipe Home → db restore → env hydrate` recovers the identical plaintext AND config `hub`/`root` survive; `--force` restore preserves a pre-existing `quarantine/keep.txt`; zip-slip vectors rejected; doctor flags a deleted referenced blob. Independent opus review (one blocking finding — config.yaml omission / whole-Home wipe — fixed; two optional gaps closed: file-custody missing-key hard error, keychain-custody restore warning).

Follow-ups:
- Keychain-custody restore lands key material as files but the restored DB still records `keychain`; the operator runs under `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` or re-migrates (surfaced at restore + documented in spec/12).

## 2026-07-04 — feat(run-loop): idempotent scan stage (P6-XP-03)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/run_loop.go`: `runLoopTick` now runs `runLoopScanAdopt` BEFORE `runSyncCycle` (the advertised scan stage; the daemonless loop otherwise had no local→hub path). The stderr tick header reads "scan + sync + materialize."
- `internal/cli/scan.go`: `findingAlreadyAdopted` (skip a finding when `store.ProjectByPath` returns an active row matching its Type and, for `git_repo`, `remote_key`) + `adoptNewFindings` (filter to genuinely-new findings, then delegate to the existing `adoptFindings`). One-shot `scan --adopt` is unchanged (still calls `adoptFindings` directly). Warning-class findings (secret-looking files, symlink escapes) and duplicate-remote findings go to stderr and are never auto-adopted (duplicates dropped in the loop; the skeleton-clobber window is closed because `writeSkeleton` writes `README.devstrap.md`, which `looksLikeProject` does not match).
- Docs reconciled: spec/00 XP-* line + spec/07 P6-XP-03 section flipped to shipped; README already read "scan + sync + materialize."

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` clean; `go build ./...`; full `go test ./...` green. `TestRunLoopScanAdoptIdempotentAndPicksUpNewRepos` (4 ticks: 1 `project.added`, mid-run pickup, no duplicate), `...SkipsDuplicateRemotes`, `...WarnsSecretWithoutAdopting`; extended `run_loop_once.txtar` asserts `pushed 2 → pushed 0`. Independent opus review: no blocking findings. Chosen direction: implement the scan stage (user-confirmed), not the doc-only fix; depended on the merged P6-XP-05 keeping scan offline.

Follow-ups (optional, from review):
- Loop scan errors currently abort the whole tick (fail-loud); a best-effort "warn + continue to sync" is a defensible alternative if a local FS hiccup should not hold remote convergence.
- Symlink-escape / case-only-path conflicts are surfaced on stderr each tick rather than recorded as `doctor`-visible conflict rows (parity is cheap via the existing dedup but out of scope here).

## 2026-07-04 — refactor(sync): pure Decide(state,event) extraction (P5-ARCH-01)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/decide.go` (new): a `ProjectionRow`/`Projection` value type (the namespace-entry subset that governs convergence, no DB handle) + a PURE `Decide(proj, event) → Decision{[]Mutation, []ConflictRecord}` (no DB/IO/`*state.Tx`, no time/rand) reusing the already-pure `reconcileSamePath`/`samePathLess`/`upsertParamsForEvent`, plus a pure `Projection.Apply(Decision)` reducer for the property test.
- `internal/sync/events.go`: `applyEventTx` reduced to load-projection (`loadNamespaceProjection`) → `Decide` → `applyDecisionTx` for `project.added/updated/deleted`. `project.renamed` (fused with `RenameProject`'s identity-preserving in-place re-key), `conflict.*`, `draft.snapshot.created`, `device.key.granted` stay inline (documented). No behavior change.
- `internal/sync/decide_property_test.go` (new): folds `Decide`+`Apply` over ALL 8! permutations of a fixed event set asserting identical final `Projection` (convergence) + duplicate-delivery idempotency. Stdlib-only deterministic permutation generator (Heap's algorithm); no new module deps.
- spec/07: a "Decide/Projection seam" note under Conflict detection.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l internal/sync` clean; `go build ./...`; `go test -race ./internal/sync/...` green (all existing apply/hlc tests unchanged + the new 40320-permutation property test); full `go test ./...` green. Independent opus review confirmed the no-behavior-change equivalence (ProjectByPath/TombstoneHLC mutual-exclusivity, rename rationale, ordering) — no blocking findings.

Follow-ups:
- Unblocks `P4-QUAL-02` (HLC-monotonicity / convergence model-checking now has a pure foundation).
- **Review-surfaced pre-existing hazard (documented, not fixed here):** a delete tombstones unconditionally with its own HLC while a re-add is gated only against the tombstone HLC, so `D@5`→`A@10` and `A@10`→`D@5` on one path converge to DIFFERENT terminal states — a real strong-eventual-consistency gap, and the one interaction the property set deliberately excludes. Candidate fix: gate the delete against the live row's source-event coords. Recorded in the ledger P5-ARCH-01 row as a follow-up.

## 2026-07-04 — fix(git): honor the stored lfs_policy on materialize/hydrate (P6-GIT-04)

Changed:
- `internal/git/git.go`: new `Runner.LFSInstallLocal(ctx, dir)` runs `git lfs install --local` — required on the materialize path because `gitEnv` sets `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, hiding any global `git lfs install` so a fresh clone would otherwise leave pointer files regardless of user config.
- `internal/cli/hydrate.go`: new `applyMaterializeLFSPolicy` mirrors `applyWorktreeLFSPolicy` — `always`/`agent` → `install --local` + `LFSPull` (fail the project on error), `auto`/`never` → warn that pointer files remain. `LFSPull` already carries the P6-GIT-01 long-transfer timeout.
- `internal/cli/materialize.go`: `materializeGitRepo` calls `applyMaterializeLFSPolicy` after `hydrateProjectUnlocked`, recording "failed" on error. **Placed in the caller, not inside `hydrateProjectUnlocked`** (which is shared by `createFreshWorktree`): the review's blocking finding was that codex's original in-`hydrate` placement (a) fired on the worktree flow and (b) missed the `SkeletonProjects` retry — a repo recorded "failed" for an LFS pull failure is re-queued and, on the already-on-disk early-return, silently flipped back to "available"/"clean" with pointers. Applying LFS in `materializeGitRepo` covers the fresh clone AND the retry, and leaves the worktree path (its own `applyWorktreeLFSPolicy`) untouched.
- spec/08: LFS section notes the materialize/hydrate path now honors `lfs_policy`.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` clean; `go build ./...`; **full `go test ./...` green** (incl. `internal/cli` real-git LFS tests and the restored `TestCreateFreshWorktreeCleansUpAfterLFSPullFailure`). New `TestMaterializeLFSAlwaysDoesNotFlipFailedToAvailableOnRetry` pins the retry invariant. Independent opus review (one blocking finding, fixed as above) + Codex implementation.

Follow-ups:
- The worktree LFS path deliberately still omits `install --local` (pre-existing; a worktree shares the parent clone's `.git/config`, where materialize now installs the filter). Not in scope.

## 2026-07-04 — fix(ignore): align the compiler with real gitignore semantics (P6-XP-02)

Changed:
- `internal/ignore/ignore.go`: three gitignore-semantics fixes on the draft-sync data plane. (1) `parseLine` now anchors on a leading **or middle** separator (`anchored = hasLeadingSlash || strings.Contains(body, "/")`) — `docs/build/` no longer also excludes `packages/site/docs/build`. (2) `patternToRegex` gains a `case '['` → `appendBracketClass` that translates a bracket expression to a real regex character class (leading `!`/`^` → `[^…]`, `\`/`]` escaped, leading `]` treated as a literal member) and **degrades an unclosed `[` to a literal `\[`** instead of returning a compile error that failed the whole file (`draft snapshot create` no longer hard-fails on `foo[1.txt`). (3) `**` crosses `/` only when it is a standalone segment (slash-bounded on both sides); a non-standalone `a**b` collapses to a single `[^/]*`.
- Behavior-preserving defaults fix: the built-in default patterns with a middle slash (`data/raw/`, `data/interim/`, `.devstrap/tmp/`, `.devstrap/cache/`) gained an explicit `**/` prefix so they keep pruning at ANY depth (project-level `data/raw`, not just the scan root) under the now-correct anchoring — otherwise a bare `data/raw/` would anchor to the workspace root and stop pruning nested project data dirs. Pinned by `TestMatchDefaults` (`data/raw` and `experiments/data/raw` both pruned) and the consumer test `internal/scan` `TestShouldPruneDir` (`work/ml/data/raw` pruned). (User-authored patterns still follow exact git anchoring — the differential test proves a user `data/raw/` is root-anchored; only the built-in defaults opt into prune-anywhere via `**/`.)
- `spec/11`: flipped the P6-XP-02 finding + the "not fully gitignore-compatible" caveat to shipped.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l internal/ignore` (clean); `go build ./...`; `go test ./internal/ignore/...` green (incl. the fuzz seed). New `ignore_gitdiff_test.go` runs the `Matcher` against `git check-ignore --verbose` over a middle-slash/bracket/`a**b`/negation corpus and asserts agreement (skips when git is absent); `TestCompileDoesNotFailOnUnclosedBracket` and `TestAnchoredMiddleSlashDoesNotMatchNested` pin the degradation + anchoring. Independent review + the differential oracle.

Follow-ups:
- `P6-XP-06` (compile the scan prune matcher from the root `.devstrapignore`) remains open — the scanner still hardwires the defaults-only matcher.

## 2026-07-04 — fix(scan): keep `scan` offline — local default-branch resolution (P6-XP-05)

Changed:
- `internal/git/git.go`: new `Runner.LocalDefaultBranch(ctx, dir, fallback)` resolves the remote default branch from LOCAL refs only — `symbolicOriginHead` (`git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`) → a local `origin/<fallback>` `rev-parse` — and NEVER runs `set-head --auto`/`ls-remote`/`fetch`. Returns the `DefaultBranchSource` (remote/stored) so callers can warn. `ResolveDefaultBranch`/`DefaultBranch` (which repair via `set-head --auto`) are unchanged and still used by hydrate/worktree materialization.
- `internal/scan/scan.go`: `Walk` now calls `LocalDefaultBranch` instead of `DefaultBranch`, so the per-repo default-branch lookup inside the `WalkDir` callback is offline. A `DefaultBranchStored`/unresolved result adds a non-authoritative warning ("… will be resolved authoritatively at materialization") rather than a network round-trip. Both scan entry points (`devstrap scan`/`scan --adopt` and first-run `devstrap init`) are now filesystem-only.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l internal/scan internal/git` (clean); `go build ./...`; `go test ./internal/scan/... ./internal/git/...` green (scan ~0.9s). Tests use an RFC-5737 blackhole remote (`192.0.2.1`) + a runner timeout larger than the sub-second elapsed budget, so a reintroduced network call would hang past the budget and trip the assertion. Reviewed by an independent opus pass (no blocking findings) + strengthened the no-network guard per its nit.

Follow-ups:
- Unblocks P6-XP-03 (an affordable per-tick `run-loop` scan stage). `--online` bounded remote repair from scan deliberately not added (deferred to materialization).

## 2026-07-04 — docs: snapshot-exchange wave close-out (P4-SYNC-02/P4-HUB-11/P4-HUB-12/P6-HUB-04 shipped + 7 quick-wins)

Changed:
- spec/00 + spec/14: compaction + full-state snapshot exchange flipped to SHIPPED (PRs #65/#73–#76); the "snapshot exchange before retention GC" gating sentences retired; next core-engine candidates re-pointed at the remaining backlog (Pass-6 11 open, `AD-1` zero-infra hub carrier, `P4-GIT-03` OS sandbox, `P4-QUAL-02`/`P5-ARCH-01` convergence property tests); spec/00's "Not implemented yet" bullet no longer claims snapshot exchange is unbuilt.
- Ledger: dated snapshot-exchange wave note added (Pass-6 19→11 open across the dual-track wave; every code PR dual-reviewed with findings fixed pre-merge); `P6-HUB-03` re-based (PR #59's per-device seq layout mooted the "HLC-ordered waves" framing — remaining work is a plain bounded fan-out of the still-serial per-event PUT loop); `P4-HUB-14` narrowed (doctor --remote half shipped; metrics/op-byte counters fully open); Pass-6 header renamed to include the snapshot-exchange wave; header count re-derived from the table (11 == 11).

Validated:
- Docs only. `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `TestEveryCommandIsDocumented` + `TestMigrationsDocumented`; ledger header count re-derived from the table.

Follow-ups:
- Live R2 dogfood run 4 (two-device `hub compact` + fresh-device snapshot bootstrap on the real bucket) is the natural next validation step.
- Next-wave candidates: remaining Pass-6 M-effort items (`P6-XP-02` gitignore semantics, `P6-XP-03` run-loop scan stage, `P6-XP-05` offline scan, `P6-GIT-04` LFS policy on materialize, `P6-DATA-04` `db backup --full`), `P5-CLI-01` renderer rollout, `P5-ARCH-01` pure-`Decide` extraction.

## 2026-07-04 — feat(hub): migrate-events + sweep lock + dedup-PutBlob freshness (P4-HUB-12 residual, spec/18 follow-ups)

Changed:
- `internal/hub/r2.go`: `R2Hub.MigrateLegacyEvents(ctx, dryRun)` re-keys the retired HLC-keyed `events/` prefix into the per-device `eventlog/` seq layout — per object: parse `(device, seq)` from the key, GET, decode, coordinate-check, conditional-PUT to the new key (412 = already migrated), **verify read-back equal bytes**, then DELETE the legacy object. Fails open: an unparseable key, undecodable body, coordinate mismatch, or read-back mismatch is reported and KEPT (never deleted), mirroring the dual-read. A dry run classifies (would-migrate vs would-keep) and writes nothing. New `parseLegacyEventKey` helper. `PutBlob` now refreshes `LastModified` on a dedup hit with one unconditional same-bytes re-put (content-addressed ⇒ byte-safe). New sweep-lock ops `GetSweepLock`/`PutSweepLock`/`DeleteSweepLock` (`meta/sweep.lock`, create-only conditional PUT → `ErrSweepLockHeld`; `LastModified` for the stale-break judgment comes from a single-key list, never the body). Imports `internal/logging` for the fail-open kept-object warnings.
- `internal/sync/hub.go`: `Hub` interface gains `MigrateLegacyEvents(ctx, dryRun)`, `GetSweepLock`/`PutSweepLock`/`DeleteSweepLock`. `FileHub`: migrate is a no-op (never used the legacy layout); sweep lock via `O_CREATE|O_EXCL`; `PutBlob` bumps the file mtime on a dedup hit. `PutBlob` doc contract updated. New `internal/sync/sweeplock.go`: `SweepLock` wire type (`{holder_device, acquired_at_hlc, ttl_seconds}`), marshal/parse, `TTL()`, and `AcquiredAt()` (HLC physical → wall time, the fallback age source), plus `ErrSweepLockNotFound`/`ErrSweepLockHeld`.
- `internal/sync/encryptedhub.go`: pass-throughs for the four new methods (legacy carriers are re-keyed byte-for-byte, the sweep lock is an unencrypted advisory head object). `recordingHub` (sync test double) gains the methods + a lock field.
- `internal/cli/hub_sweeplock.go` (new): `hubSweepLock(store, hub, ttl)` — create-only acquire; on conflict, read the lock and refuse with the holder id (`exit-conflict`) unless it is older than its TTL (judged by backend mtime), in which case break-and-reacquire ONCE; returns a `release` func the caller defers. Pure `sweepLockStale` helper.
- `internal/cli/hub_migrate.go` (new): `devstrap hub migrate-events` (`--hub-file`, `--dry-run`); a real run takes the sweep lock first.
- `internal/cli/hub.go` / `hub_compact.go`: `hubGC` and `hubCompact` acquire the sweep lock after their pre-sync and before any destructive op (dry runs take none); the "run from one designated device" caveats are retired in both help texts.
- Tests: `internal/hub/r2_migrate_test.go` (full memS3 matrix + migrate-then-pull equivalence + wrong-bytes-readback-keeps), `internal/hub/r2_sweeplock_test.go` (R2 lock lifecycle + `TestR2PutBlobDedupRefreshesLastModified`), `internal/sync/sweeplock_test.go` (FileHub lock + mtime refresh + marshal round-trip + no-op migrate), `internal/cli/hub_sweeplock_test.go` (helper acquire/refuse/break/release, gc/compact/migrate acquisition, gc-race grace-window regression), e2e `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/hub_migrate_events.txtar` (the documented no-op-against-`--hub-file` contract).
- Specs: 03 (P6-HUB-01 dedup residual closed + designated-device caveat retired), 07 (migrate-events shipped, dual-read kept as the safety net), 13 (new command + lock semantics in gc/compact, command list), 15 (advisory-lock threat note + freshness closes the gc race), 16 (test inventory), 19 (migrate-events + sweep-lock runbook), this log. Ledger: `P4-HUB-12` moved to *Recently shipped*; the spec/18 PR #59 follow-ups (`hub migrate-events`, revoked-device cleanup) are closed.

Shipped-choice deviations (from the PR spec):
- **`MigrateLegacyEvents` takes a `dryRun` bool** rather than a separate plan method, so the dry run reuses the exact classification path (parse/get/decode/coordinate-check) and reports accurate would-migrate/would-keep counts while writing nothing — the smallest interface surface that keeps the preview honest.
- **Sweep lock is three raw Hub methods + a `internal/cli` helper**, not a single `AcquireSweepLock` Hub method, because the break-stale/refuse/holder-id policy is client logic (and needs `store.CurrentDevice`/`CurrentHLC`), while the backends only owe the raw create-only/get-with-mtime/delete ops — the smallest surface that keeps policy out of the backends.
- **Read-back verification compares raw bytes.** A Push-written twin serialized differently than the legacy object fails the equal-bytes check and is conservatively KEPT (the dual-read still dedups it by event ID), rather than deleted on a looser decode-equality check — fail-open toward keeping.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go vet ./internal/... ./cmd/...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `golangci-lint run`; `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...` (all green; `internal/git TestCloneTimeout*` is a known flake).

Post-review (Codex, dual-review) — two fixes landed on top:
- **(P1) gc stale-list vs re-put race.** `hubGC` held `BlobInfo.LastModified` from its pre-sweep `ListBlobs`; a concurrent sync's dedup re-put refreshes the object AFTER that list, and gc would still delete from the stale snapshot — the sweep lock cannot close this (it serializes sweepers, not syncing devices). Added `Hub.StatBlob(ctx, sha256Hex) (BlobInfo, error)` (FileHub `os.Stat`; R2Hub via a new `S3Client.StatObject` HEAD in `s3client_awssdk.go` + memS3; EncryptedHub passthrough; `recordingHub` double gains a `blobTimes` map). `hubGC` now re-stats each candidate immediately before `DeleteBlob`: missing → skip (already gone), fresh mtime within grace → skip (just re-referenced), stat error → skip (fail safe). Pinned by `TestHubGCRevalidatesBeforeDeleteKeepsRefreshedBlob` (a `staleListHub` wrapper: stale LIST mtime, fresh STAT mtime → blob survives).
- **(P2) lock release not owner-aware.** `release()` unconditionally deleted `meta/sweep.lock`, so a sweeper that overran the 1h TTL would delete the SUCCESSOR's lock after a legitimate stale-break. `SweepLock` gains a per-acquire `crypto/rand` `Nonce`; `hubSweepLock`'s `release()` now GETs the lock and deletes ONLY when the bytes still match the exact body this acquire wrote (the narrow GET→DELETE TOCTOU is acceptable for an advisory lock, noted in the comment). Pinned by `TestHubSweepLockReleaseIsOwnerAware` (A overruns, B stale-breaks + re-acquires, A's late release leaves B's lock intact).
- Docs updated: the `PutBlob` doc contract in `internal/sync/hub.go` names `StatBlob` as its read-side partner; spec/03, spec/13, and spec/15 now describe the gc race as closed **end-to-end** (refresh + pre-delete revalidation); spec/16 lists both new tests.

## 2026-07-04 — feat(sync): signed per-device sync acks + tombstone GC + revoked-stream cleanup (P4-SYNC-06 narrowed, P6-HUB-04 completion)

Changed:
- New `internal/sync/ack.go`: `AckMarker` wire format (`{cursor, device_id, hlc_watermark, produced_at_hlc, pushed_through_seq, v, workspace_id, sig}`, alphabetical json tags mirroring `RetentionManifest`), `SignAckMarker`/`VerifyAckMarker`/`ParseAckMarker` under the reserved `AckSignatureDomain` (`devstrap:ack:v1`); a nil cursor signs over an empty map so a peer-streamless device is canonical.
- `Hub` interface gains `PutAck`/`ListAcks`/`DeleteAck` (ack head-object plane, `meta/acks/<device_id>.json`) and `DeleteDeviceStream` (reclaim a revoked device's event-log prefix). Implemented on `FileHub` (new `-meta/acks/` dir, array filter for stream delete), `R2Hub` (`workspaces/<ws>/meta/acks/` via the existing S3Client ops; device-id path-safety guard), and `EncryptedHub` (pass-throughs — acks are signed plaintext head objects). Test doubles updated: `recordingHub` (sync) gains an in-memory ack map + stream filter; `recordingHub` (cli) and `faultHub` embed the interface and compile automatically.
- `internal/cli/sync.go`: `maybeWriteSyncAck` publishes the local device's signed ack after a FULLY-CLEAN cycle (push not deferred; no truncated/skipped/undecryptable pull; no quarantined/cursor-held apply; no open `sync_skipped_events`). Best-effort (a PutAck failure logs a warning, never fails sync). An unchanged cycle (same consumed cursor + push watermark, cached in `local_meta` `sync_ack:<hubID>`) skips the redundant PUT; the HLC clock is excluded from that compare because it drifts every cycle. `HLCWatermark`/`ProducedAt` = `store.CurrentHLC` (the device clock, ≥ every applied event HLC after a clean cycle).
- `internal/cli/hub_compact.go`: `--gc-tombstones` flag (default true). `planTombstoneGC` derives `beforeHLC = min(local live HLC, every approved non-local device's verified ack watermark)`; a missing approved-device ack SKIPS GC with a naming hint; revoked/lost/pending/unknown or bad-signature/mismatched acks are ignored. GC runs before `BuildSnapshot` (first production caller of `store.GCTombstones`), so purged tombstones are excluded from the produced snapshot. `cleanupRevokedStreams` (after the confirm read-back + `CompactEventsBelow`) reclaims the whole `eventlog/<dev>/` prefix and deletes the ack of every revoked/lost device the committed floors fully cover. `--dry-run` reports the GC decision via new `store.CountTombstonesBelowHLC` without mutating.
- `internal/cli/devices.go`: revoke/lost best-effort `DeleteAck(revokedID)` when a hub is configured.
- Specs: 07 (ack plane + checkable tombstone-GC invariant + revoked-stream cleanup; status flip), 12 (`event_delivery`/`sync_cursors` definitively dead, superseded by the ack plane), 13 (sync ack, `compact --gc-tombstones`, revoke ack deletion), 15 (withheld/stale/forged ack is availability-only), 16 (test inventory), this log. Ledger: `P6-HUB-04` shipped, `P4-SYNC-06` closed-as-narrowed.

Shipped-choice deviations (from the PR spec):
- **Revoked cursor row + floor retained, not deleted.** The spec permitted `prefix-delete + DeleteAck + cursor-row delete` while keeping the floor. Deleting the local pull cursor while the manifest floor stays reopens the retention gate (`after[dev]+1 < floor`), forcing a needless snapshot recovery on the compacting device's next sync. Shipped the safer consistent option: reclaim the stream prefix + delete the ack, and RETAIN both the floor and the cursor (a floor+cursor for an empty stream is harmless). `store.DeleteHubDeviceCursor` was therefore not added.
- **No tombstone-GC e2e txtar.** Producing an `EventProjectDeleted` tombstone through the real binary needs a user-facing delete command, which does not exist (confirmed in PR3). Tombstone GC + revoked cleanup are driven at the Go level instead (`hub_compact_tombstone_test.go`, `sync_ack_test.go`).
- **Ack unchanged-skip compares cursor+push only**, not the full payload-minus-sig the spec suggested, because the HLC watermark drifts every cycle and would defeat the skip; an unchanged cursor+push means the last published watermark still bounds the consumed set.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go vet ./internal/...`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `golangci-lint run`; `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...` (all green; `internal/git TestCloneTimeout*` is a known flake).

## 2026-07-03 — feat(hub): hub compact — snapshot producer + floor advance + cold-event deletion (P4-HUB-11)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/hub_compact.go` (new): `devstrap hub compact` — the snapshot-exchange PRODUCER. Flags `--hub-file`, `--dry-run`, `--keep-snapshots` (default 2), `--min-events` (default 0). Order is load-bearing (confirm-before-delete): converge (shared gate + push local pending so `floors[self]` covers local history) → compute floors from the transport cursors (remote `pullCursor+1`, self `pushWatermark+1`, cursor-0 devices skipped) → reconcile against the current manifest (fail-closed verify producer = local or approved, refuse a floor rollback, carry forward absent devices) → `--min-events` guard before any write → build+seal the snapshot under the CURRENT-epoch WCK → `PutSnapshotObject` → sign + CAS `PutRetention` (one re-read-and-retry on `ErrRetentionConflict`, error on a second) → read-back confirm names our snapshot → `CompactEventsBelow` → advance our own pull cursors to the floors (so the next sync is incremental, not a self-snapshot demand) → prune superseded snapshot objects. A keyless device refuses.
- `internal/cli/hub.go`: extracted the pre-sweep gate into the shared `refuseIfIncompleteView` (pull+apply+recover, blob-cache, all incomplete-view refusals) used by BOTH `hub gc` and `hub compact`; ADDED a new gate — an open `key_grant_waits` row refuses. `errGCRefused` is retained as an alias of the shared `errIncompleteView` sentinel so existing gc assertions stay green; `hubGC` now calls the helper (behavior identical).
- `internal/sync/snapshot_build.go` (new): `BuildSnapshot` assembles the `snapshot.v1` document from store reads (symmetric to `snapshot_import.go`); leaves V/Epoch/KID for `SealSnapshot` to stamp.
- `internal/state/snapshot_reads.go` (new): `SnapshotEntries` (active namespace map + git_repos + latest draft pointer, source coords), `SnapshotTombstones` (surviving deleted rows), `ChainAnchorsForFloors` (per device, the content-hash/hlc of the event at seq=floor-1 from the events table, falling back to the imported `sync_chain_anchors` row, skipping devices with neither), and `CurrentHLC` (the local clock without minting an event). No migration (00020 shipped in part 2).
- Tests: `internal/cli/hub_compact_test.go` (happy path incl. re-compact; dry-run writes nothing; `--min-events` refusal; the shared gate incl. the new key-grant-wait gate; keyless refusal; confirm-before-delete ordering via a `recordingHub`; CAS conflict retry-once; keep-snapshots pruning; `reconcileCompactFloors` monotonicity/carry-forward/unapproved-producer unit pins). E2e `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/hub_compact_roundtrip.txtar` (A compacts; B incremental; fresh C bootstraps from the snapshot via the pairing ceremony and materializes both projects; hub is ciphertext-only) and `hub_compact_refuses_incomplete.txtar` (plaintext-downgrade wedge → refusal, nothing written).
- Specs: 07 (producer/compaction protocol section; flipped "producer lands later"), 13 (`hub compact` doc mirroring `hub gc`, command list), 15 (old-epoch containment narrowed — snapshots seal under the current epoch; byzantine withhold+forge recovery real end-to-end; `P6-HUB-04` producer half shipped), 16 (compact test inventory), 19 (compaction runbook). Ledger: `P4-SYNC-02` and `P4-HUB-11` moved to *Recently shipped*; `P5-HUB-03` closed as subsumed.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run` (clean); `go test -race ./...` (all packages green); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.
- `TestEveryCommandIsDocumented`/`TestMigrationsDocumented` pass; both new txtars pass through the real binary.

Follow-ups:
- Tombstone GC (`P4-SYNC-06`) + signed per-device sync acks (`P6-HUB-04` completion) + revoked-stream cleanup land as the next PR of the wave; the sweep lock (retiring the single-designated-device caveat) and `hub migrate-events` follow.

## 2026-07-03 — feat(sync): snapshot import + ErrSnapshotRequired recovery (P4-SYNC-02 part 2)

Changed:
- Migration `00020_sync_chain_anchors.sql`: per-device hash-chain anchors imported from a snapshot (`sync_chain_anchors(workspace_id, device_id, anchor_seq, anchor_content_hash, anchor_hlc, snapshot_sha256, imported_at)`, PK `(workspace_id, device_id)`). Schema version 19 → 20.
- `internal/state/store.go`: `previousEventContentHash` gains an anchor fallback in the `Seq>1` branch — when the seq-1 predecessor is absent (a snapshot-bootstrapped device holds no rows below the floor), it resolves the anchor by `(device_id, anchor_seq)`, so the first post-floor event per device verifies instead of hash-chain-quarantining forever. New `Tx.UpsertChainAnchor` (keeps the highest `anchor_seq`), `Tx.TombstoneByPathKey` + extracted `tombstonePath` helper, `Tx.ProjectByPathKey`, generic `Store.GetLocalMeta`/`SetLocalMeta`, and `Store.ApprovedDeviceSigningKey` (the snapshot-recovery trust gate — signing key only for a locally approved device).
- New `internal/sync/snapshot_import.go`: `ImportSnapshot(ctx, st, snap, snapshotSHA256, hubID)` — a pure LWW merge in one transaction (direct derived-state writes on source-event coords, NO synthetic events), tombstone gating (newer local add wins; dirty checkout → `pending_delete_conflict`; else tombstone by path_key), draft-pointer idempotency, chain-anchor upsert, `ReceiveRemoteHLC(snap.HLC)`; then forward-only cursor advance to `floor-1` and a monotonic `retention_floor:<hubID>` cache in `local_meta`. Idempotent and order-independent with event replay. Exported `RetentionFloorMetaKey`/`LoadRetentionFloorCache`.
- New `internal/cli/snapshot_recovery.go`: `recoverFromSnapshot` — get + fail-closed-verify the manifest (unapproved producer / bad sig / sha mismatch / AEAD failure ⇒ refuse at exit `invalid-config`; hub/fetch failure ⇒ `network`), floor-rollback guard, pull the tail first (ingest in-batch grants), unseal under held WCK candidates (keyless ⇒ defer, exit 0, import nothing), cross-check workspace id + floors, `ImportSnapshot`, pull imported-draft blobs. Wired into `runSyncCycle` and `hubGC`'s pre-pull (replacing the old `ErrSnapshotRequired` dead-ends), each recovering once then retrying the incremental pull. `pullReferencedBlobs` refactored to share `pullBlobsByRef`; `buildKeyringFromPaths` added for the opts-free gc caller.
- Specs: 07 (Import + Recovery subsections; status flipped for the import half), 12 (migration 00020 + `sync_chain_anchors` table section + schema version 20 + amended the penciled gitstate reservation to "next free number at landing time"), 13 (sync recovery behavior + exit-code mapping; gc pre-pull recovers too), 15 (P6-HUB-04 import-verification shipped; byzantine withhold+forge recovery path now real; P4-SEC-04 bootstrap-state-acquisition residual narrowed), 16 (test inventory).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (passes against the committed PR-1 HEAD; this PR is uncommitted per the delegation contract); `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...`.
- New tests: `internal/state/chain_anchor_test.go` (anchor fallback pass/mismatch/orphan; max-seq keep), `internal/sync/snapshot_import_test.go` (LWW matrix, tombstone gating both directions + unknown-path-blocks-stale-add, dirty conflict, draft idempotency, re-import idempotency, import/apply order-independent convergence), `internal/cli/sync_snapshot_recovery_test.go` (fresh-device bootstrap end-to-end, unpinned-producer refusal, keyless-joiner defer, floor-rollback warning, sha-mismatch refusal). Bumped the schema-version pins in `store_test.go` and the `db status` assertion in `root_test.go` to 20.

Follow-ups:
- Same wave: `hub compact` producer (PR 3) — its txtars cover the full 4-device roundtrip (behind-floor recovery + backlog push; fresh-joiner-via-pairing-code bootstrap) not reachable at the Go level without the producer sealing a live snapshot.
- No ledger rows move yet: `P4-SYNC-02`/`P4-HUB-11`/`P6-HUB-04` close with the producer PR.

## 2026-07-03 — feat(sync): snapshot + retention wire format and hub snapshot plane (P4-SYNC-02 part 1, P6-HUB-04 format)

Changed:
- New `internal/sync/snapshot.go`: the `snapshot.v1` wire format — `Snapshot` document (namespace entries with source-event coords, latest draft pointers, surviving tombstones, per-device chain anchors, per-device floor map), sealed under the CURRENT-epoch WCK with an enc.v2-style XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD (`snapshotAAD` binds workspace id, producing device, sealing key's kid, producer HLC, epoch; the envelope kid field stays an unauthenticated routing hint exactly like enc.v2). Content-addressed: object key = sha256 of the sealed bytes. `RetentionManifest` (per-device floors + snapshot ref + `prev_sha256` chain) signed under the new `devstrap:retention:v1` domain with a canonical alphabetical-key payload (v2-event style); `devstrap:ack:v1` reserved for the tombstone-GC ack markers; `devstrap:snapshot:v1` reserved-unused. Sentinels: `ErrSnapshotVerification`, `ErrRetentionNotFound`, `ErrRetentionConflict`, `ErrRetentionRollback`.
- `internal/sync/hub.go`: the `Hub` interface grows the retention/snapshot plane — `GetRetention`/`PutRetention` (CAS: `""` = create-only, else If-Match; lost race = `ErrRetentionConflict`), `PutSnapshotObject`/`GetSnapshotObject`/`ListSnapshotObjects`/`DeleteSnapshotObject`, `CompactEventsBelow(floors)` (deletes strictly below each device's floor; never Seq<=0). FileHub implements all of it (`<hub>-meta/retention.json`, `<hub>-snapshots/<sha>.json`, sha256-of-bytes etags); `Pull` now reads the manifest floors (merged with the `RetentionSeqs` test override) and a garbled manifest is a HARD error — fail closed, a hub cannot garble its way to "no floor".
- `internal/hub/r2.go`: R2 keys `workspaces/<ws>/meta/retention.json` + `workspaces/<ws>/snapshots/<sha256>.json`; Pull reads the marker unverified (backends hold no device registry; an unverified floor can only force the snapshot path, where fail-closed import verification lives — P6-HUB-04's DoS-only analysis); `CompactEventsBelow` bounds the seq-layout listing at the floor key per device and, in the legacy layout, deletes only parseable `(device, seq)` keys below their device's floor — unparseable legacy keys are KEPT (fail safe, inverting the dual-read's fail-open GET for the destructive path).
- `internal/hub/s3client_awssdk.go` + `mems3_test.go`: `S3Client` grows `GetObjectWithETag` and `PutObjectIfMatch` (If-Match CAS — an S3 extension R2 supports on PUT; aws-sdk-go-v2 s3 v1.104.1 models `PutObjectInput.IfMatch`); memS3 simulates etags (sha256 of body) and CAS conflicts.
- `internal/sync/encryptedhub.go`: pure pass-through delegation for the new plane (snapshot sealing lives in the caller; the manifest is signed plaintext by design).
- Specs: 07 (new *Snapshot exchange and event-log compaction* section: wire format, manifest, trust model; retention paragraph re-based to the shipped manifest), 15 (P6-HUB-04 bullet flipped to shipped-format+plane with the unverified-pull/fail-closed-import trust split), 16 (test inventory), 19 (bucket layout updated to eventlog/ + snapshots/<sha256>.json + meta/retention.json; the `.json.age` reservation retired with the WCK-not-age rationale).

- Post-review (Codex P1 + 2×P2): `ParseRetentionManifest` now validates structure fail-closed — `{}`/null-floors/wrong-version/negative-floors/empty-device are ERRORS, never "no floor" (a hub could otherwise garble its own marker into serving a partial post-compaction log as complete); `R2Hub.PutRetention` disambiguates a 412 by read-back byte comparison (a conditional PUT retried after an ambiguous failure would 412 against its OWN commit — that is success, not a lost race); `FileHub.PutRetention` serializes its read-check-write under an O_EXCL lock file (stale-broken after 10s) with an atomic temp+rename install, so two same-etag writers can never silently overwrite each other.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (one unrelated flake: `internal/git` `TestCloneTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetryOrWipe`, passes on rerun — pre-existing, also seen by an independent session today).
- New tests: seal/unseal + AAD tamper matrix (kid relabel harmless), manifest sign/verify + tamper matrix + canonical re-parse pin, FileHub/memS3 CAS conflict matrices, Pull floor gates (at-floor boundary exact; fresh device forced to snapshot; garbled manifest hard-errors), both-layouts compaction with unparseable-legacy-keys-kept.

Follow-ups:
- Same wave, next PRs: migration `00020_sync_chain_anchors` + `store.ImportSnapshot` + `ErrSnapshotRequired` recovery in `sync`/`hub gc` (PR 2); `hub compact` producer (PR 3); signed per-device sync acks + tombstone GC + revoked-stream cleanup (PR 4); `hub migrate-events` + sweep lock + dedup-`PutBlob` freshness (PR 5).
- No ledger rows move yet: `P4-SYNC-02`/`P4-HUB-11`/`P6-HUB-04` close when their consumer/producer halves land.

## 2026-07-03 — fix(cli): refuse split-brain init root changes (P6-CLI-01)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/init.go`: before `EnsureWorkspace`, `init` now reads the existing workspace root and compares it to the effective resolved requested root (`DEVSTRAP_ROOT`, `--root`, or positional `[root]`, after absolute clean normalization). Different roots refuse with `exitConflict` and name both roots plus the `--move-root` remedy; `--move-root` accepts the relocation and rewrites ONLY the top-level `root:` line of `config.yaml` (surgical line update, atomically through a same-directory temp file + rename with mode `0600`), so user-added settings (`hub:`, key/sync tuning) and comments survive the move — regenerating from the default template would have silently wiped them (post-review fix, pinned by the hub-setting/comment preservation assertions in `TestInitMoveRootRewritesConfig`). Same-root re-init remains a no-op success, and first-init join flows are unchanged.
- Tests: added `TestInitReRunSameRootSucceeds`, `TestInitReRunNewRootRefusedWithConflict`, and `TestInitMoveRootRewritesConfig`.
- Specs/ledger: `spec/13` documents `--move-root` and marks `P6-CLI-01` resolved; `docs/audits/README.md` moves `P6-CLI-01` to *Recently shipped* and reconciles Pass-6 to 18 open rows.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-cli01 go test -race ./internal/cli/ ./...` (first full run hit a transient `internal/git` temp-count read in `TestCloneTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetryOrWipe`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-cli01 go test -race ./internal/git` and the required full command rerun were green).

## 2026-07-03 — specdrift: require specific spec owners for internal packages

Changed:
- Added `TestEveryInternalPackageHasASpecificSpecOwner`, which loads the real `spec/` frontmatter and walks the real top-level `internal/` package directories so a new internal package cannot rely only on broad `internal/**` / catch-all mappings.
- Extended specific `tracks_code` ownership where the specs already describe the packages: `spec/03` now owns `internal/config/**`; `spec/07` now owns `internal/id/**` and `internal/pairing/**`; `spec/16` now owns `internal/specdrift/**`.
- Ledger: moved `P6-DOC-04` to *Recently shipped* because both halves are now closed: the earlier `internal/workspacekeys/**` frontmatter fix and this new-package mapping regression gate.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-doc04 go test -race ./internal/specdrift/ ./...`.

## 2026-07-03 — hermetic SSH alias forge tests (P6-QUAL-04)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/forge_test.go`: added a temp `ssh` executable PATH shim that emits canned `ssh -G` output by hostname case; existing alias/forge tests now use the stub and no longer depend on the machine's OpenSSH config. Added `TestSSHAliasResolutionUsesStub` to prove the marker hostname comes from the stub.
- Specs/audits: `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md` marks the P6-QUAL-04 inventory shipped; `docs/audits/README.md` moves `P6-QUAL-04` to *Recently shipped* and reconciles Pass-6 to 18 open rows.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-qual04 go test -race ./internal/cli/ ./...`
- Pass-6 open-table rows recounted: 18.

## 2026-07-03 — fix(materialize): rebuild before env hydrate (P6-GIT-03)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/materialize.go`: `materializeGitRepo` now runs the existing `DEVSTRAP_REBUILD_DEPS`-gated dependency rebuild before `hydrateProjectEnv`, preserving best-effort warning behavior; rebuild stdout/stderr is written to `~/.devstrap/logs/rebuilds/<sanitized-project-path>.log` with mode `0600`, and rebuild failures name the log path.
- `internal/cli/materialize_test.go`: added `TestMaterializeRebuildsBeforeHydrate` and `TestMaterializeRebuildLogIsWritten0600`.
- `spec/08_GIT_MATERIALIZATION_AND_WORKTREES.md`: corrected the current rebuild ordering/logging and documented the global env-var gate vs the future per-project policy, including the defense-in-depth caveat.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: moved `P6-GIT-03` to *Recently shipped* and reconciled the Pass-6 open count to 18.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-git03 go test -race ./internal/cli/ ./internal/...`

Follow-ups:
- Per-project `materialization.rebuild_on_hydrate: ask|always|never` remains target design; the shipped gate is still the single global `DEVSTRAP_REBUILD_DEPS` env var.

## 2026-07-03 — P6-QUAL-05: scope CI push triggers + add concurrency cancellation

Changed:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: scoped `push` CI triggers to `main` while keeping `pull_request` and the daily schedule, and added workflow-level PR-only cancellation via `concurrency`.
- `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md`: updated the MinIO CI trigger description from every push/PR to `main` pushes and pull requests, with PR supersession cancellation.
- `docs/audits/README.md`: moved `P6-QUAL-05` to *Recently shipped*, decremented the Pass-6 open count, and reconciled the Pass-6 open-table row count.

Validated:
- `python3 -c "import yaml,sys; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"`.
- Pass-6 open table recount.

## 2026-07-03 — fix(ignore): ShouldPruneDir bare-name fallback defeated anchored/negation patterns (P6-XP-01)

Changed:
- `internal/ignore/ignore.go`: `ShouldPruneDir` no longer re-evaluates patterns against the directory's bare name as a fallback when the full-path match misses. `relSlash` is now the sole match target; the empty-path guard (`relSlash == "" -> name`) is kept only for a caller with no path at all. Audited both live callers (`internal/scan/scan.go`, `internal/draftbundle/draftbundle.go`) — both already compute `relSlash`/`rel` via `filepath.Rel` against their walk root for every non-root directory, so no caller changes were required.
- `internal/ignore/ignore_test.go`: added `TestShouldPruneDirAnchoredPatternDoesNotPruneNested` (`/dist/` must not prune `packages/app/dist`), `TestShouldPruneDirNegationReincludes` (`build/` + `!keep/build/` keeps `keep/build`), `TestShouldPruneDirRootLevelStillPruned` (`/dist/` still prunes top-level `dist`).
- Ledger: `docs/audits/README.md` — `P6-XP-01` moved to *Recently shipped*; Pass-6 header **19 → 18 open of 43** (open-table rows re-counted: 18).
- `spec/11_IGNORE_AND_LOCAL_GARBAGE.md`: the `P6-XP-01` section rewritten from problem/actionable-steps to a `SHIPPED`/`**Resolved.**` writeup matching the ledger convention.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-xp01 go test -race ./internal/ignore/... ./internal/scan/...` — pass
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-xp01 go test -race ./...` — full suite pass, including `internal/draftbundle`

Follow-ups:
- None for this finding. `P6-XP-02` (gitignore-semantics divergence) and `P6-XP-06` (scanner hardwires the defaults-only matcher) remain separately tracked, open Pass-6 findings.

## 2026-07-03 — fix(agent): diff committed work against recorded base (P6-GIT-02)

Changed:
- `internal/cli`: `agentDiffSummary` now takes the recorded base SHA, reports `Committed since base:` from `BaseSHA..HEAD`, and reports `Uncommitted:` from `git status --short`; unborn-HEAD repositories keep the previous working-tree-only fallback. Added real-git coverage for committed agent changes, uncommitted residue, and unborn HEAD.
- `spec/10`, `spec/13`, `spec/15`: agent diff-summary, PR-flow, CLI, and stale-base threat-model wording updated for the committed-vs-uncommitted split.
- Audit ledger: `P6-GIT-02` moved to *Recently shipped* and the Pass-6 open count/table reconciled to 18.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-git02 go test -race ./internal/cli/ ./...`

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-03 — docs: sync-convergence wave close-out (P5-SYNC-01 + 7 Pass-6 findings shipped)

Changed:
- Ledger: `P5-SYNC-01` (PR #59), `P6-SYNC-02` (PR #63), `P6-DATA-03`/`P6-DATA-05`/`P6-DATA-06` (PR #61), `P6-XP-04` (PR #62), `P6-QUAL-01`/`P6-QUAL-02` (PR #60) moved to *Recently shipped*; Pass-6 header **26 → 19 open of 43** (open-table rows re-counted: 19); Pass-5 line 4 → 3 open (`P5-CLI-01`, `P5-ARCH-01` partial, `contextcheck`); dated wave note added.
- Pass-6 audit doc: dated SHIPPED stamps on the seven closed sections; a premise-correction note on `P6-SYNC-02` (the cursor half was superseded by the P5-SYNC-01 per-device cursor before the fix; PR #63 closed the records/surfacing residual, and no `--replay-skipped` was built); the stale Appendix A closing note about P4-SEC-02/P4-SEC-07 ledger status resolved as historical.
- spec/00 + spec/14: the AD-2 multi-device hardening freeze is **COMPLETE** — all four named criticals shipped; new capability planes unblocked; compaction/snapshot exchange (`P4-SYNC-02`/`P4-HUB-11`) called out as the highest-leverage next core-engine item (also the recovery path for the documented byzantine-hub residuals).
- spec/00 current-state bullet refreshed (per-device Seq cursors + durable pull-drop records).
- spec/16 AD-6: status flipped to largely-shipped with the honest remainder (applied `device.revoked` propagation; randomized chaos reordering).

- Post-review (opus): spec/03's AD-2 block flipped to COMPLETE too (it still framed the freeze as pending with `P5-SYNC-01` open); the passes-index Pass-5 row updated to 33 shipped / 3 open (it contradicted its own detail section); the Pass-6 header-note parenthetical now names all six non-P6 *Recently shipped* rows.

Validated:
- Docs only. `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `TestEveryCommandIsDocumented` + `TestMigrationsDocumented`; ledger header count re-derived from the table (19 == 19).

Follow-ups:
- None for this wave. Next core-engine candidate: `P4-SYNC-02`/`P4-HUB-11` compaction + snapshot exchange.

## 2026-07-03 — typed keychain custody + never mint over a published identity (P6-XP-04)

Changed:
- `internal/platform/platform.go`: `mapKeyringError` now classifies untyped godbus/Secret-Service-unreachable errors (dead session bus) as `ErrUnsupported` via a new `secretServiceUnreachable` needle set — the substring recognition moved DOWN to the layer closest to go-keyring, so higher layers rely only on typed sentinels. (Deviation from the audit's step 2, which said keep the substring cases in `devicekeys`; moving them to `platform` is strictly better and still keeps the headless file fallback working.)
- `internal/devicekeys/devicekeys.go`: replaced the `err.Error()` substring heuristic with `errors.Is` against `platform.ErrUnsupported`/`ErrSecretNotFound`; added `Custody` (`keychain`/`file`/unset) with `WithCustody`/`Probe`; `Ensure`/`EnsureSigning` now take the device's published public key and refuse to mint a divergent identity when the keychain is unreachable or a key is already published but its private half is absent (`mintGuard`); unified read/store through `resolveSecret`/`storeSecretCustody` that honor custody (keychain custody fails closed, file custody skips the keychain, legacy/unset preserves today's fallback); `LoadWCK`/`StoreWCK` inherit the same guards; new exported `ErrKeychainUnreachable`.
- `internal/state`: migration `00019_local_meta.sql` (local, never-synced KV); `KeyCustody`/`RecordKeyCustody` (write-once) + `EffectiveKeyCustody` (DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN override); `ensureLocalEventSignature` threads the published signing key + recorded custody into `EnsureSigning`.
- `internal/cli`: `resolveKeyStore` is side-effect-free (reads recorded custody + NO_KEYCHAIN override); recording happens once, at init, via `recordKeyCustodyAtInit`, and only from *safe evidence* — `file` on NO_KEYCHAIN, `keychain` on a positive probe, and `file` from an unreachable probe ONLY for a genuine first init (no already-published keys). An unreachable probe on an already-initialized store records nothing and stays unset (fixes a wedge where a pre-`00016` keychain-only store, first run headless, would strand later desktop runs). `buildKeyring`, doctor, init, and the env/blob_gc/materialize/run reads plus the hub-cred slot all thread the recorded custody through custody-aware stores; new `doctor` `key custody` row.
- Specs: `spec/09` key-custody model + SECR-04 refinement; `spec/15` split-custody-wedge threat (mitigated) + custody status; `spec/06` P6-XP-04 marked shipped with the platform-layer deviation called out + headless note; `spec/05` custody one-liner; `spec/13` doctor row; `spec/12` migration `00016` + schema version 16.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run` (0 issues, fresh cache); `go test -race ./...` (all green).
- New tests: `internal/devicekeys/custody_test.go` (typed not-found mints; unreachable+published refuses with remedy and writes no file; keychain-custody fails closed; unset+unreachable+nothing-published preserves file fallback; untyped error fails closed; `Probe` classification); `internal/platform` `TestMapKeyringErrorClassification` (dbus→ErrUnsupported, hard error stays untyped); `internal/state/custody_wedge_test.go` (headless dead-D-Bus regression through `InsertLocalEvent` — refusal + no divergent key file; custody write-once round-trip; NO_KEYCHAIN override); `internal/cli` init-records-file-custody-under-NO_KEYCHAIN + doctor custody row, `TestRecordKeyCustodyAtInitNeverStrandsAnAlreadyInitializedStore` (headless init on an already-initialized store stays unset, no file recorded/written), `TestRecordedFileCustodyNeverConsultsKeychain` (file custody reads the file key, a stale keychain entry never shadows it).
- Dual-review fixes (Codex P2s): (P2-1) recording moved out of `resolveKeyStore` into `recordKeyCustodyAtInit`, gated so a mere unreachable probe never records `file` on an already-initialized store; (P2-2) `devstrap run`'s env decrypt now threads the recorded custody through `resolveKeyStore`; and the hub-credential slot (`resolveHubS3Credentials`/login/logout) now threads recorded custody too — the only other unstamped construction site found.

Follow-ups:
- Live Linux Secret Service integration under a real `service install` daemon (`XP-03`) remains the standing coverage gap; the recorded custody decision is the prerequisite that is now in place.

## 2026-07-03 — fix(sync): durable, classified pull-drop records (P6-SYNC-02 residual)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/encryptedhub.go`: drop classes re-classified by recoverability. Unknown envelope version (newer client) now defers its ORIGIN DEVICE's tail within `sync.key_grant_grace` (per-device, like a missing grant) and quarantine-forwards past it (post-upgrade replay recovers it); malformed envelopes forward straight to the undecryptable quarantine (the durable conflict IS the record); retired enc.v1 and anti-downgrade plaintext stay dropped-never-applied with durable records. New `NoteSkipped` seam + `SkipReason*` constants; `EnvelopeVersion` partial-parse helper in eventcrypt.
- Migration `00018_sync_skipped_events.sql` + `Store.NoteSkippedEvent` (stable first-seen = the unknown-version grace clock), `OpenSkippedEvents`, `Tx.ClearSkippedEventTx`; `ApplyEvents` clears an event's records in the same tx that CONSUMES it — on apply and on dedup (a restored object for an event this device already holds arrives as a dedup).
- Surfacing: `status` "Skipped hub events: N"; `doctor` "skipped hub events" (per-reason breakdown + remedies: upgrade / re-found / investigate the hub); `hub gc` refuses to sweep while any record is open (the durable table outlives one pull's in-memory stats).
- Deliberately NOT built: `sync --replay-skipped` (nothing to rewind under the per-device Seq cursor — held classes self-retry at the gap, quarantined classes ride `ReplayUndecryptableConflicts`), and skip records for the grant-ingestion branches (`key_grant_waits` + verification conflicts already surface those precisely; a second row would double-count with no lifecycle).
- Post-review (Codex P2): a parseable-JSON envelope claiming a version AT OR BELOW ours ({} decodes to version 0) is junk, not "a newer client" — it forwards for quarantine immediately and never buys the grace-window defer a hostile hub could use to hold a device's cursor (`TestEncryptedHubImplausibleVersionQuarantinesImmediately`); only a strictly-greater claimed version (the upgrade-recoverable class) defers. Opus review: SHIP, no blocking findings.
- Tests: encryptedhub class matrix (defer-within-grace with sighting recorded, quarantine-past-grace, nil-seam defer-forever, malformed forward, implausible-version immediate quarantine), store record tests, clear-on-apply AND clear-on-dedup, e2e `sync_skipped_surfacing.txtar` (hub downgrade → record + status/doctor + gc refusal → restore → record clears). Schema pins 17→18.
- Specs: 07 (P6-SYNC-02 → shipped; AD-6 bullet flipped; cursor-caveat updated), 12 (00018 + version 18 + table section; gitstate reservation → 00020, 00019 claimed by the in-flight key-custody PR), 13 (sync/status/doctor/gc surfacing + the deliberate no-flag note), 16 (test inventory).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (incl. the new e2e).

Follow-ups:
- Old-epoch containment and snapshot exchange remain the recovery path for the documented byzantine withhold+forge residual (spec/15, P4-SYNC-02).

## 2026-07-03 — feat(sync): transport cursor decoupled from HLC — per-device Seq pull plane (P5-SYNC-01)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/hub.go`: `Cursor` type (origin device -> last contiguous Seq pulled+consumed); `Hub.Pull(ctx, after Cursor)` replaces `Pull(ctx, afterHLC)`; FileHub filters by per-device Seq (Seq<=0 legacy events always delivered, dedup by ID) with per-device `RetentionSeqs`.
- `internal/hub/r2.go`: Push writes the per-device seq-ordered layout `workspaces/<ws>/eventlog/<device_id>/<seq pad20>_<event_id>.json` (refuses Seq<=0); Pull discovers device streams via delimiter listing (`S3Client.ListCommonPrefixes`, implemented in the aws-sdk adapter + memS3 double), resumes each with an exact StartAfter boundary, DUAL-READS the retired HLC-keyed `events/` prefix (parsed (device, seq) pruned by the cursor; unparseable keys fail open toward the GET), dedups by event ID across layouts, and re-bases the retention floor per device. `HasEvents` checks both prefixes. No bucket wipe needed; `hub migrate-events` is a follow-up (dual-read is O(1) on an empty prefix).
- `internal/sync/events.go`: `ApplyEventsWithStats(ctx, st, events, after)` returns the per-device safe cursor — the contiguous CONSUMED run from `after[dev]+1` (consumed = applied / deduped / permanently quarantined; deliberate change: dedup now advances, ending the founder's eternal self-re-pull). Transient holds (skew, hash-chain) stop only the offending device's run (per-device fault isolation); a hub-side seq gap stops it loudly; at a contested slot held dominates consumed (a forged carrier — every field of an undecryptable envelope is hub-writable — can never advance past a real held event, superseding the PR #44 implausible-HLC guard).
- `internal/sync/encryptedhub.go`: within-grace missing-key truncate becomes a PER-DEVICE defer — the ungranted origin device's batch tail is dropped (counted in `Truncated`) while other devices' events keep flowing; contiguity holds the deferred device's cursor with no extra plumbing. Skip classes unchanged in behavior but their failure mode improves for free: a skipped object now leaves a seq gap that HOLDS its device's cursor (retry every pull) instead of being silently passed forever (P6-SYNC-02 re-based; durable record + surfacing still open).
- Migration `00017_hub_device_cursors.sql` + store: `HubDeviceCursors`/`AdvanceHubDeviceCursor` (forward-only), `PushSeqCursor`/`AdvancePushSeqCursor` (push watermark by gapless Seq; post-review: NO backfill from the legacy HLC watermark — Codex P2: inferring "pushed" from `hlc <= watermark` would permanently strand an unpushed regressed-HLC event, so a migrated store re-pushes local history once, idempotent + an opportunistic re-key), `HasHubDeviceCursors`, `LocalPendingEventsBySeq`. `hub_cursors` (00008) frozen read-only.
- `internal/cli/sync.go`: per-device cursor wiring in `pullAndApplyEvents`; push by Seq; founder gate now requires zero rows in BOTH cursor tables (a pre-migration device that ever synced must never self-found, P6-SEC-02). `doctor` pending-push and the joiner-mismatch probe read the new cursors.
- Tests: R2 late-push/dual-read/discovery/retention + FileHub mirrors, ApplyEvents per-device matrix incl. the forged-carrier contested-slot case, EncryptedHub per-device defer, store cursor/no-legacy-backfill/HLC-regression coverage, founder-gate per-device-cursor case; e2e `sync_late_push.txtar` (3 devices — verified FAILING on origin/main, the negative control); `sync_materialize.txtar` no-op pull expectation 1 -> 0 (HUB-13 overlap retired); schema pins 15 -> 17 (goose Down lands on 15 pending the sibling 00016 — re-derive at rebase).
- Specs: 07 (cursor sections rewritten; P5-SYNC-01 flipped to shipped; P6-SYNC-02 re-based to the retry-wedge residual), 12 (hub_device_cursors DDL + migration list + version 17 + hub_cursors frozen + gitstate reservation -> 00019), 13 (sync/hub-plane cursor text), 16 (test inventory).

- Post-review (Codex P2 + opus SHIP-WITH-FIXES): legacy push-watermark backfill REMOVED (see above); same-seq/different-id equivocation now classifies as `ErrDivergentEvent` in `insertEvent` — a byzantine or backup-restored device re-minting a sequence number quarantines that one event instead of aborting every pull batch forever (`TestApplyEventsSameSeqDifferentIDQuarantinesAsDivergent`); the withheld-occupant-plus-forged-carrier byzantine-hub residual is documented honestly (seqOutcome comment + new spec/15 threat section) instead of overclaimed; `ListCommonPrefixes` pages by continuation token (start-after-a-prefix re-listed that device's keys past 1000 streams); doctor's joiner-mismatch probe reads PULL cursor rows only (push watermarks no longer suppress the warning).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (incl. all existing sync/join/gc/wedge txtars + the new late-push e2e).

Follow-ups:
- PR 2 of this wave (P6-SYNC-02 residual): durable `sync_skipped_events` + status/doctor surfacing + `sync --replay-skipped`; unknown-envelope-version defer classification.
- `hub migrate-events` (legacy-prefix re-key + delete); per-device retention markers with the snapshot-exchange work (P4-SYNC-02/P4-HUB-11); revoked-device prefix/cursor cleanup alongside compaction.

## 2026-07-03 — fix(data): atomic local event/state writes + device HLC indexes (P6-DATA-03/05/06)

Changed:
- Local project add/adopt/conflict-resolution/key-grant emission paths now write the event row and derived state/audit row inside one SQLite transaction using Tx-scoped event constructors and store seams.
- Added migration `00016_device_hlc_index_single_local.sql` with `idx_events_device_hlc` and a partial unique `idx_devices_single_local`; `EnsureDevice` now adopts a concurrent winner after `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
- Specs updated for schema version 16, the shipped P6-DATA-03/05/06 behavior, and the reserved gitstate migration renumbering.

- spec/13: `add`/`scan --adopt`/`conflicts resolve` sections document the one-transaction event+state commit (required by the tightened two-tier drift gate that merged mid-wave, PR #60 — its first genuine catch).

## 2026-07-03 — fix(quality): precise spec-drift owners + verified release tags (P6-QUAL-01/P6-QUAL-02)

Changed:
- `internal/specdrift`: mapped-spec satisfaction now ignores `**` catch-all matches, requires a specific owner when one exists, and falls back to broad `cmd/**`/`internal/**` specs only for files with no specific owner. Added regression tests for work-log catch-all non-satisfaction, specific satisfaction, broad-spec non-satisfaction when a specific owner exists, and broad-only satisfaction.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: GoReleaser now depends on a read-only `verify` job that confirms the tagged commit is contained in `origin/main` or `origin/release/*`, then runs `go vet`, race tests, and pinned `govulncheck@v1.1.4` before publishing.
- Specs: `spec/16` documents the two-tier mapped-spec rule and release verification gate; `spec/14` release-gate prose now reflects the verified tag workflow.
- Post-review (opus): verify job hardened — `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` + `timeout-minutes: 15` mirroring ci.yml (a blocked go-keyring D-Bus call must not hang a 6h default), the ancestry check anchored on full refnames (`^refs/remotes/origin/(main|release/.+)$` — `origin/mainline` lookalikes no longer match), redundant pre-fetch dropped, `cache: true` on setup-go.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-pr5 GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE=/tmp/devstrap-golangci-cache-pr5 go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` (0 issues); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-pr5 go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (20 specs, 6 changed files); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-pr5 go test ./internal/specdrift`; `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache-pr5 go test -race ./internal/specdrift/ ./...`. The exact race command without `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` hit sandboxed macOS keychain failures in `internal/workspacekeys`; `actionlint` was not installed.

Follow-ups:
- Add a GitHub `v*` tag-protection ruleset manually in repository settings.
- Cosign/SLSA/SBOM release hardening stays open under `P4-SEC-05`/`P4-QUAL-05`.
- The new-package-no-owner gap stays open under `P6-DOC-04`.

## 2026-07-03 — docs: pairing + rotation runbook close-out (P4-SEC-04 / P4-SEC-07 shipped)

Changed:
- `spec/19` §E rewritten to the final two-paste ceremony (E.1 founder pairing-code → E.2 `init --join --code --fingerprint` adopt+pin in one step → E.3 hub-login ordering trap → E.4 `enroll --code --approve --fingerprint` + sync both), plus new §E.5 rotation cadence (90d auto-rotate, `keys rotate`, forward-exposure-only, revoke-for-compromise, doctor rows) and §E.6 wedge recovery (grace-bounded quarantine symptom → re-approve from a complete device → automatic replay; `--allow-epoch-gap` semantics incl. the hub-gc refusal).
- README two-device quickstart rewritten to the 2-paste ceremony + one rotation-cadence line, deep-linking §E.
- Staleness sweep: spec/09 (3×) and spec/15 (1×) no longer claim fingerprint confirmation / pairing UX "remain future work" — parts 1+2 shipped; remaining work is authenticated snapshot exchange + remote trust propagation.
- Ledger: `P4-SEC-04` (PRs #54/#57) and `P4-SEC-07 (rotation)` (PR #56) rows added to *Recently shipped*; the open Pass-4 rows now point there. Pass-6 header unchanged (**26 open of 43** — Pass-4 findings never counted toward the 43); open-table rows re-counted: 26.

Validated:
- Docs only. `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `TestEveryCommandIsDocumented` + `TestMigrationsDocumented`.

Follow-ups:
- None for this wave. Deferred (documented-not-built): old-epoch containment, keychain-slot growth, authenticated snapshot exchange, remote trust propagation.

## 2026-07-03 — feat(keys): periodic WCK rotation — manual command + age-triggered auto-rotate (P4-SEC-07 remainder)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/keys.go`: new `devstrap keys rotate` — calls `Keyring.Rotate` directly (pure rotation: no secret-rotation flags, no blob rewrap, no queued hub deletes — those are revoke semantics); refuses at epoch 0.
- `internal/state/store.go`: `ActiveKeyEpochAge` — highest epoch, EARLIEST created_at across its kids (conservative; coexisting kids can only make a rotation earlier).
- `internal/cli/sync.go`: `maybeRotateWorkspaceKey` in `runSyncCycle` — AFTER `pullAndApplyEvents` (a freshly ingested grant resets the local age; suppresses fleet rotation storms), BEFORE `pushLocalEventsGated` (grants ride this cycle), followed by a `LocalPendingEvents` RE-READ so the mint's grant events are pushed same-cycle. Config `keys.rotate_max_age` (default 2160h = 90d, `0` disables, strict parse) + `sync --key-max-age` per-run override (validated as a usage error). Skips epoch 0; at most one rotation per cycle; a failed rotation warns and never aborts the sync.
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: `workspace key age` check (pure `gradeWorkspaceKeyAge`: ok at epoch 0 / ok with age / warn past `keys.rotate_max_age` with the rotate remedy).
- Tests: `ActiveKeyEpochAge` (empty/highest/MIN-across-kids), `keys rotate` mints+grants and pins the no-revoke-side-effects contract against a real captured binding / refuses keyless, sync auto-rotates a backdated epoch with the grant ON THE HUB in the same cycle (the re-read assertion) / disabled at 0 / keyless joiner never rotates / malformed `--key-max-age` is a usage error, doctor grade table, e2e `sync_rotate_converge.txtar` (rotation mid-sync; grant + epoch-2-sealed project ride one push; B converges in one pull; doctor clean).
- Post-review (Codex P1): `Keyring.Rotate` now wraps EVERY grant before writing any state (a malformed approved-recipient row aborts with no epoch row, custody slot, or events — pinned by `TestRotateBadRecipientLeavesNoHalfMintedEpoch`), and a rotation failure is FATAL for the sync cycle instead of warn-and-continue (pushing would seal events under a half-minted epoch whose grants never published, with the fresh created_at suppressing retries).
- Specs: 13 (`keys` section, `--key-max-age`, config, doctor row) + 00 command inventory, 07 (Periodic-rotation lifecycle bullet incl. the harmless concurrent-mint push-key non-convergence note), 09 (WCK vs secret rotation distinction), 15 (forward-exposure-only threat section; old-epoch containment + keychain-slot growth documented-not-built); ledger: open `P4-SEC-07` row narrowed to shipped (row moves in the wave's docs close-out PR).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (incl. the new e2e).

Follow-ups:
- Docs close-out PR: spec/19 §E ceremony+rotation runbook rewrite; ledger row moves (P4-SEC-04, P4-SEC-07 → Recently shipped).
- Documented-not-built: old-epoch containment; keychain-slot growth (one 32-byte key per epoch).
## 2026-07-03 — feat(devices): one-paste pairing codes (P4-SEC-04 part 2)

Changed:
- Added `internal/pairing`: `devstrap-pair1:` compact JSON/base64url codes carrying workspace id, device id, display name, OS, arch, age recipient, and signing public key. Decode is deliberately unauthenticated and ignores unknown JSON fields; validators reuse `id.Valid`, `age.ParseX25519Recipient`, and `devicekeys.Fingerprint` parsing.
- Added `devstrap devices pairing-code`: stdout is exactly the blob plus newline; stderr prints the local fingerprint and the two command forms to run on the other device.
- Added `devices enroll --code`: rejects positional ids and manual identity/key flags, checks workspace id, then falls through to the existing epoch-contiguity, fingerprint-confirm, upsert, grant, and quarantine-replay flow. Composition target: `devices enroll --code "$CODE" --approve --fingerprint "$FP"`.
- Added `init --join --code` + `--fingerprint`: decodes and verifies before filesystem writes, adopts the founder workspace id, pins the founder as approved with a matching fingerprint, prompts on a TTY, or stores the founder pending with a warning/follow-up command in non-TTY use.
- Tests: pairing unit round-trip/error/unknown-field/whitespace coverage, CLI pairing-code/enroll/init coverage, and `sync_join_flow.txtar` rewritten to the two-paste code ceremony.
- Specs: `spec/00`, `spec/07`, `spec/13`, `spec/15`, `spec/19`, and the audit ledger text updated for the shipped part-2 pairing code.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run` (0 issues); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` incl. the rewritten `sync_join_flow` e2e (re-run in the main session after the line-by-line diff review).

Follow-ups:
- None for `P4-SEC-04` local pairing; authenticated snapshot exchange, synced trust propagation, and broader automation remain separate backlog items.

## 2026-07-03 — feat(devices): device-key fingerprint + compare-and-confirm on approve (P4-SEC-04 part 1)

Changed:
- New `internal/devicekeys/fingerprint.go`: `Fingerprint(signingPublicKey, ageRecipient)` derives a full 256-bit device fingerprint — `sha256("devstrap/device-fp/v1" || 0x00 || canonicalSigning || 0x00 || canonicalRecipient)`, both inputs canonicalized by parse-then-re-encode (reusing `parsePublicSigningKey` + `age.ParseX25519Recipient`), encoded as unpadded uppercase base32 in 13 dash-separated groups of 4. Plus `NormalizeFingerprint` and constant-time `FingerprintEqual`.
- `devices approve` and `enroll --approve` now gate the trust-state change on out-of-band fingerprint confirmation BEFORE any DB write (`--fingerprint <value>` compare / interactive `yes` on a TTY / non-TTY refusal with a copy-paste remedy). Fingerprint is computed from the approved row/flags, never the local keystore. `SECU-05`: approving a keyless placeholder row is refused with a re-enroll remedy.
- `devices recipient --fingerprint` prints the local device's fingerprint (mutually exclusive with `--signing`/`--workspace-id`; bare output frozen). `devices list` appends the fingerprint as the LAST column (`-` when a row lacks keys); `--json` unchanged.
- `init --join` hint gained fingerprint-comparison guidance and a `devices recipient --fingerprint` step.
- Spec: `13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` (flags + list column + confirmation model), `15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md` (new MITM/tamper-on-pairing-channel threat; full-strength-vs-SAS rationale), `07_NAMESPACE_AND_SYNC_MODEL.md` (approve bullet), `19_CLOUD_PROVISIONING_GUIDE.md` §E (interim note + `--fingerprint` on the ceremony examples). Ledger P4-SEC-04 row narrowed (fingerprint half shipped, pairing-code half open).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `go test -race ./...` (all green).
- New golden-vector test pins the derivation forever; both-keys-bound, normalization/equality, CLI match/mismatch-no-write/non-TTY-remedy/keyless-refuse tests; e2e txtar (`sync_*`, `hub_gc_stale_marks`) updated to scrape `devices recipient --fingerprint` and pass `--fingerprint`.

Follow-ups:
- One-paste pairing code that bundles + integrity-checks the seven exchanged values (`P4-SEC-04` part 2). Founder-side automation of the exchange and an authenticated full-state snapshot remain future work.
## 2026-07-03 — fix(sync): grace-bounded quarantine for never-granted epochs + approve contiguity guard (P6-SEC-03)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/encryptedhub.go`: `EncryptedHub` gains `MissingKeyWait` (seam to `Store.NoteMissingKeyGrant`) + `GraceWindow`; BOTH truncate sites (missing epoch; unheld kid at a held epoch — also the forged-kid stall primitive) now truncate only within the grace window and forward the still-encrypted carrier to the `P6-SYNC-04` undecryptable quarantine past it, so the cursor advances and later held-epoch events still apply. Nil seam = legacy truncate-forever (unit tests).
- Migration `00015_key_grant_waits.sql` + `Store.NoteMissingKeyGrant`/`OpenKeyGrantWaits`: stable first-seen per missing key; the grace clock is the epoch's EARLIEST first-seen across kids (hostile kid relabeling cannot restart it); `RecordKeyEpoch` clears satisfied waits.
- `internal/cli/sync.go`: `ReplayUndecryptableConflicts` moved BEFORE `ApplyEventsWithStats` in `pullAndApplyEvents` (a recovered predecessor applies before its same-batch successors — one-cycle convergence); `sync.key_grant_grace` config (default 72h, `0` = immediate, strict parse with default fallback), wired in `hubFromOptions`.
- `internal/sync/events.go` + `Tx.ResolveOpenConflictsByEventID`: an event that finally applies auto-resolves its open `event_hash_chain_break` conflict (the successor of a once-quarantined event no longer leaves a stale gc-blocking conflict).
- `internal/cli/devices.go`: `checkEpochContiguity` guard on `devices approve` + `enroll --approve` (before any trust write) — refuses when held epochs have a gap in `1..max` or any key-grant wait is open; `--allow-epoch-gap` overrides; keyless devices pass (founder-pinning ceremony untouched).
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: `awaiting key grants` check listing open waits with the re-approve remedy.
- Tests: encryptedhub grace cases (within/expired × both sites, nil seam), `key_grant_waits` store tests, `TestSyncQuarantinesNeverGrantedEpochThenRecovers` (full cycle incl. same-cycle recovery), `devices_epoch_guard_test.go`, e2e `sync_never_granted_epoch_wedge.txtar` (three-device fleet, revoke-triggered epoch 2, unknown-to-rotator device quarantines → guard trips → `--allow-epoch-gap` → re-approve recovers).
- Specs: 07 (P6-SEC-03 section rewritten as shipped; Pull-semantics bullet grace-bounded), 12 (migration 00015 + schema v15), 13 (config key, guard flag, doctor row), 15 (new epoch-injection DoS threat section), 16 (test inventory); ledger: `P6-SEC-03` → Recently shipped, Pass-6 header 27→26.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (incl. the new e2e).

Follow-ups:
- Periodic (non-revoke) WCK rotation (`P4-SEC-07` remainder — next PR in this wave; rotation multiplies exactly the windows this PR bounds).
- Documented residual: a rotator grants only locally-known approved devices; unknown fleet devices ride grace→quarantine→replay until re-approved. Old-epoch containment documented-not-built.

## 2026-07-03 — docs(claude): report-only nudge rule for delegated workers (pairing-wave field note)

Changed:
- `CLAUDE.md` model-picker field notes: nudges to worker subagents must be report-only ("post your report; make no further edits") — a nudged worker may run another pass and silently overwrite main-session fixes in its worktree; generic check added: re-diff a delegated worktree immediately before committing. Also updated the line-by-line-review note (it has now caught real issues from Codex diffs).

Validated:
- Docs only; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-03 — docs: spec-accuracy sweep (4 stale claims vs shipped code)

Changed (docs only — findings from a full spec-folder validation pass against `d0b696a`):
- `spec/00_START_HERE.md`: the command inventory now lists `hub gc/login/logout` (login/logout shipped with `P6-HUB-02` but the hand-maintained list only had `hub gc`; the `TestEveryCommandIsDocumented` gate checks only `spec/13`, so nothing auto-catches this list).
- `spec/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`: the `P6-HUB-02` section rewritten from an open "Problem./Actionable steps." to the file's "Was./Shipped fix." convention — keychain/`op://` credential custody, `hub login`/`logout`, and the `ErrS3Auth` branch all shipped 2026-07-03 (PR #45).
- `spec/08_GIT_MATERIALIZATION_AND_WORKTREES.md`: the `P6-GIT-05` section likewise rewritten as shipped (`removeOrphanWorktree` under a detached bounded context; the same file's line ~187 already described the shipped behavior, so the section also self-contradicted); the doctor orphan-worktree check is noted as deliberately out of scope.
- `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md`: dropped `--no-bootstrap` from the `hydrate` flag list — the flag does not exist in `internal/cli/hydrate.go` and was listed with no "planned" marker.

Validated:
- Docs only; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli/ -run 'TestEveryCommandIsDocumented|TestMigrationsDocumented'`.

Follow-ups:
- None. The sweep's other spot-checks (command/flag inventories, migrations 00001–00014, exit codes, testscript references, shipped/planned event-type split) all matched the code.

## 2026-07-03 — Pairing wave (docs): founder-minted / joiner-adopted workspace id + pairing runbook

Changed (docs only — no code, no migration this cycle):
- `spec/19_CLOUD_PROVISIONING_GUIDE.md`: §A.2 corrected — the `workspace_id` is minted on the **founder** and adopted by a joiner via `init --join --workspace-id <id>`, not "minted during init" on every device. Added a new **§E "Pair a second device"** runbook: founder founds + `hub login` + `sync` + `status` (copy the id) + shares the id/device-id/age-recipient/signing-key out-of-band; joiner runs the id-adopting `init --join --workspace-id <id>` **first**, pins the founder (`devices enroll … --approve`) **before** first sync, then `hub login` (keychain-ordering trap called out: the `hub-s3.<workspace_id>` slot keys on the id); founder enrolls+approves the joiner and syncs; joiner syncs and the tree materializes. Includes the "Not supported: changing the workspace id on an initialized store" note with the remove-`~/.devstrap`-and-reinit remedy.
- `spec/07_NAMESPACE_AND_SYNC_MODEL.md`: the identity prose (~:213) and the WCK Init-lifecycle bullet now say the workspace id is founder-minted / joiner-adopted (born-correct, mismatch refused), pointing at `spec/19` §E.
- `spec/15_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`: new threat subsection — `workspace_id` is a prefix selector excluded from signatures by design (re-stamped empty on apply), exchanged out-of-band alongside the key exchange; a wrong id yields an empty prefix and a hostile id yields only quarantined ciphertext, never accepted content. Residual = the `P4-SEC-04` pre-enrollment window.
- `README.md`: added a concise **"Pair a second device"** quickstart mirroring the §E runbook.
- `docs/audits/README.md` (ledger): added a `P4-SEC-07 (pairing)` row to *Recently shipped*; trimmed the open `P4-SEC-07` row to "periodic (non-revoke) rotation (see `P6-SEC-03`)" (kept open); narrowed the open `P4-SEC-04` row to the founder-side-automation + fingerprint-UX residual (kept open, joiner half closed). The pairing-wave rows are Pass-4 findings and do not count toward Pass 6's 43, so the Pass-6 header stays **27 open of 43** (open-table rows re-counted: 27); the header-count note now says so explicitly.

Validated:
- Docs-only; no code touched. `spec/18` (this file) is touched so the spec-drift gate is satisfied on commit. `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli/ -run 'TestEveryCommandIsDocumented|TestMigrationsDocumented'` stays green — no command or migration changed; this wave's flags land in PRs A–C, whose own PRs update `spec/13`/`spec/12`.

Follow-ups:
- Founder-side automation of the pairing exchange + an in-band fingerprint-confirmation UX (`P4-SEC-04` residual); periodic (non-revoke) WCK rotation (`P4-SEC-07` residual, `P6-SEC-03`).

## 2026-07-03 — doctor: workspace-id mismatch detection + hub prefix-isolation regression test

Changed:
- `internal/hub/r2.go`: added `R2Hub.HasEvents`, a retried one-object `ListObjectsV2` probe over the workspace event prefix for cheap populated-prefix detection.
- `internal/sync/hub.go`: added `FileHub.HasEvents` with the same any-event semantics for the file-backed hub.
- `internal/cli/doctor.go`: `doctor --remote` now reports the local `workspace id` row and warns joiners on R2/S3 hubs when the pull cursor is still 0 and the raw backend has no events under this device's workspace-id prefix.
- Tests: added R2 workspace-prefix isolation coverage, FileHub/R2 `HasEvents` coverage, the pure mismatch-heuristic table test, and a Go-level doctor hub-health test for the workspace-id row plus file-hub warning gate.
- Specs/docs: updated `spec/13_CLI_DAEMON_API.md` for the new doctor rows and `docs/audits/README.md` for the still-open `P4-SEC-07` remainder.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- The `devstrap init --join --workspace-id` adoption flag shipped in PR A of this same pairing wave (merged ahead of this change); the remaining `P4-SEC-07` remainder is periodic (not just revoke-triggered) WCK rotation (`P6-SEC-03`).

## 2026-07-03 — P4-SEC-04 (joiner half): founder-pinning ceremony before first sync (pairing wave)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/devices.go`: reworded the keyless-joiner grant warning — the old text read as if the *enrolled* device were awaiting a grant; it now states the approval pins that device's keys for fail-closed verification while this joiner receives its own key later. No mechanism change: `grantWorkspaceKeyToApprovedDevice` was already founder-gated, and one approved row already flips `hasEnrolledDevices` fail-closed.
- `internal/cli/init.go`: the join hint gained the pinning step (pin the founder — and, in a multi-device fleet, every other existing device — via `devices enroll … --approve` BEFORE the first sync; an unpinned signer's events quarantine and replay on approval, per the Codex review of this PR). The bare-join recovery step is now scoped to r2/s3 hubs (file hubs need no id).
- Tests: `internal/cli/devices_pin_founder_test.go` — keyless-joiner `enroll --approve` exits 0, emits no `device.key.granted`, epoch stays 0; a forged grant from an unknown device quarantines on the pinned joiner BEFORE its first sync (TOFU closed pre-sync); a founder-signed (v2 domain) grant still ingests to epoch 1 with zero conflicts. `sync_join_flow.txtar` gained the pinning step on device B and stays green end-to-end.
- Specs: `spec/15` TOFU passages narrowed (joiner half closed by the documented ceremony; residual = founder-side automation + fingerprint UX + authenticated snapshot); `spec/13` devices prose; `spec/07` Approve lifecycle bullet; `docs/audits/README.md` P4-SEC-04 row narrowed (stays open).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- Founder-side automation of the pairing exchange + in-band fingerprint-confirmation UX (`P4-SEC-04` residual). The two-device runbook documenting this ceremony lands in the pairing-wave docs PR.

## 2026-07-03 — P4-SEC-07: workspace-id pairing — `init --join --workspace-id` adopts the founder's id (pairing wave)

Changed:
- `internal/id`: new `Valid(prefix, value)` canonical-shape check (`<prefix>_` + 32 lowercase hex); the package gained its first tests (the spec/00 + spec/16 `internal/id` test exemption ended).
- `internal/state`: `EnsureWorkspaceWithID` adopts an explicitly supplied workspace id under the singleton index (fresh insert / idempotent re-ensure / `ErrWorkspaceIDMismatch` refusal on a store initialized under a different id — no post-hoc rewrite); `EnsureWorkspace` refactored to mint + delegate, and a lost concurrent mint race now adopts the survivor; `Summary` gained `WorkspaceID` (JSON `workspace_id`).
- `internal/cli/init.go`: `--workspace-id <id>` flag (implies `--join`), shape-validated before any filesystem write; mismatch maps to exit 2 with a remove-and-reinit remedy; bare `--join` warns non-fatally that r2/s3 hubs key by workspace id; `--dry-run` prints the would-adopted id; existing-config `--join` re-runs warn the config was not modified; the join hint now walks founder-`status` → copy Workspace ID → `init --join --workspace-id <id>`.
- `internal/cli/status.go`: human output gained a `Workspace ID:` row (JSON via `Summary`).
- `internal/cli/devices.go`: `devices recipient --workspace-id` print-only flag (mutually exclusive with `--signing`; the bare default output stays frozen for scripts).
- Tests: `internal/id` table tests; `internal/state/workspace_id_test.go` (adopt/idempotent/mismatch/memo/FK safety/mint-delegation); `internal/cli/init_workspace_id_test.go` (adopt+implies-join, invalid shape refused before MkdirAll, reinit-different-id refusal, bare-join warning, dry-run, recipient `--workspace-id` + frozen default); `sync_join_flow.txtar` threads the founder's id through the joiner's init and asserts both stores report one id (proves the flag inert on the file hub).
- Specs: `spec/13` init/status/devices sections; `spec/07` HLC-section identity paragraph (pairing shipped, founder-minted/joiner-adopted); `spec/00` workspace-identity + test-coverage bullets; `spec/16` coverage-gate wording + TEST-03 note; `docs/audits/README.md` P4-SEC-07 row annotated (pairing shipped; rotation remainder stays open).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (includes the extended `sync_join_flow` e2e).

Follow-ups:
- PR B of this wave documents the joiner-side founder-pinning ceremony (P4-SEC-04 joiner half); PR C ships doctor mismatch detection + the hub prefix-isolation regression test; PR D ships the two-device runbook. Periodic WCK rotation stays open under P4-SEC-07/P6-SEC-03.

## 2026-07-03 — P6-CLI-05: document the shipped r2:// hub path (R2 go-live wave)

Changed:
- README: dropped the "(landing)" / "wired but not switched on" framing for the R2/S3 hub (Features bullet, project-status blockquote, Architecture components line), reworded the "Not yet implemented" hosted-hub bullet to the genuinely-remaining items (production remote device enrollment, out-of-band fingerprint confirmation), rewrote quickstart step 6 to show `hub: r2://<bucket>` in `~/.devstrap/config.yaml` + `DEVSTRAP_HUB_S3_*` credential env vars (with `devstrap hub login` / 1Password `op://` and a `spec/19` pointer, keeping `--hub-file` as the local-test path), taught the command-reference `sync` row about the config hub, re-pointed the roadmap near-term priorities off the now-done "wire the R2 backend" onto event-log compaction/snapshot exchange + retention marker + HTTP/SSE relay + daemon, and bumped the latest-audit reference from the fifth to the sixth pass.
- `internal/cli/init.go`: the default and `--join` next-steps hints now teach configuring `hub: r2://<bucket>` in `~/.devstrap/config.yaml` then plain `devstrap sync`, instead of hardcoding `devstrap sync --hub-file <path>`.
- `internal/cli/sync.go`: `--dry-run` now prints the resolved hub ID (`hubID`, always non-empty: `file:<path>` / `r2:<ws…>`) instead of the raw `--hub-file` flag, which was empty when the hub came from config.
- `internal/cli/root_test.go`: extended the sync dry-run assertion to require the resolved `file:<path>` hub ID in the output.
- Specs: `spec/13` P6-CLI-05 block marked RESOLVED and its init/sync descriptions updated; `spec/02` success-metrics AD-1 note points at the now-documented R2 quickstart; `docs/audits/README.md` ledger row moved to Recently shipped and the Pass 6 open count decremented.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `golangci-lint run`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./internal/cli/ ./internal/specdrift/`.

Follow-ups:
- None. Explicit non-goal: no `devstrap init --hub <uri>` flag — the hub stays configured in `config.yaml` as one source of truth.
## 2026-07-03 — P6-HUB-02: keychain/op:// hub S3 credential custody + auth error hint (R2 go-live wave)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/hub.go`: `selectBackendHub` now resolves the hub S3/R2 credential pair through `resolveHubS3Credentials` (most-explicit-first: `DEVSTRAP_HUB_S3_*` env/config where either value may be a 1Password `op://` ref resolved via a new `resolveOpRef` helper — `op read --no-newline` under the sanitized `childenv` allowing `OP_*` — then `AWS_*` literals, then the per-workspace keychain slot). The resolved secret rides `redact.Secret` and is revealed only at the `hub.NewS3Client` call. New `devstrap hub login` (hidden-prompt/piped-stdin secret, never argv; refuses `op://` literals; reports keychain-vs-file landing) and `devstrap hub logout` commands.
- `internal/devicekeys`: per-workspace `HubS3Credentials` custody slot (`hub-s3.<workspace_id>` keychain account, `hub-s3-<workspace_id>.json` 0600 file fallback) with Store/Load/Delete on `HybridStore`, same fail-closed keychain semantics as WCK custody.
- `internal/hub`: new `ErrS3Auth` sentinel; `mapS3Error` maps 401/403/`AccessDenied`/`SignatureDoesNotMatch`/`InvalidAccessKeyId` to it with a remediation hint (previously the raw SDK error).
- New dependency `golang.org/x/term` (hidden terminal prompt).
- Specs: spec/19 custody block flipped PLANNED→shipped and documents the resolution order + `hub login`; spec/13 documents `hub login`/`logout` and the custody order; spec/15 custody paragraph updated — the three specs no longer contradict each other (age-blob custody variant explicitly not built; keychain + op:// cover the client need).

Validated:
- `gofmt`; `golangci-lint run` (0 issues); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (all green: resolution-order table incl. PATH-shim fake `op`, login/logout round-trip under `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN`, devicekeys file round-trip + 0600 mode + path-hostile refusal, `mapS3Error` auth rows); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` after commit.

- Dual-review fixes (gpt-5.5): (1) the op:// secret branch no longer returns early — it falls through to the keychain fill and final validation, so a `hub login`-stored access key id pairs with a rotated op:// secret and a missing key id gets the two-remedy error (pinned by `TestResolveHubS3CredentialsOpSecretWithStoredKeyID`/`...MissingKeyID`); (2) `hubS3Creds` gained String/GoString/LogValue — fmt cannot dispatch a Stringer on an unexported field, so a bare `%+v` would have dumped the raw secret (pinned by `TestHubS3CredsNeverFormatsSecret`); (3) the SECR-04 fail-closed property (hard keychain failure errors instead of falling to file) now has its first real test, `TestHubS3CredentialsHardKeychainFailureFailsClosed`, which also pins the pre-existing stale-file-preferred residual. CodeRabbit: `op read` bounded (60s + WaitDelay, pinned by `TestResolveOpRefTimesOut`), spec/13/19 wording reconciled. Second (opus-4.8) review concurred on the op:// Major; its cross-source half-mixing concern is declined by design — the stored-key-id + rotated-op://-secret combination both reviews require IS a cross-source pair, and a mismatch fails closed with the `ErrS3Auth` hint; its test-hermeticity fix (clear `AWS_*` in stored-pair tests) and `source`-comment wording are applied.

Follow-ups:
- Live two-machine R2 dogfood using `hub login` against the registered bucket (wave close-out); hosted-mode temporary prefix-scoped credentials remain `P4-SEC-08`.
- Review-noted UX follow-ups (non-blocking): TTY paste-both-lines can strand the secret between the bufio reader and `term.ReadPassword` (real-terminal path, untestable in CI); `run-loop` preflight (`hubConfigured`) validates hub shape but not credential resolvability, so a broken credential surfaces on the first tick rather than at preflight; single-line piped `hub login` without `--access-key-id` consumes the line as the key id.
## 2026-07-03 — P6-QUAL-03: run the MinIO hub conformance test in CI (R2 go-live wave)

Changed:
- Added a `minio-conformance` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: boots a digest-pinned `minio/minio` (RELEASE.<tag>) via `docker run -d ... server /data` (GitHub `services:` cannot pass the required command), curl health-waits on `/minio/health/live` (dumping `docker logs` on timeout), and runs `go test ./internal/hub/ -run TestR2MinIOConformance -v` with `DEVSTRAP_HUB_S3_*` pointed at `http://localhost:9000` (`minioadmin` credentials, bucket `devstrap-test` — the test creates its own bucket). The default `go test` invocation stays hermetic; the job is intentionally not a required branch-protection check yet (promote after it proves stable).
- `spec/16_TEST_PLAN.md`: conformance-test paragraph + P6-QUAL-03 block updated to the shipped state.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (no output).
- `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12 run`.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (uncommitted worktree changes; re-verify after commit).
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/hub/ ./internal/specdrift/`.

Follow-ups:
- Promote `minio-conformance` to a required check once it proves stable; MinIO ≠ R2, so live-R2 dogfooding still applies (`P6-HUB-02` wave close-out).
## 2026-07-03 — P6-SYNC-04: enc.v2 — bind the full carrier tuple into the AEAD AAD (R2 go-live wave)

Changed:
- `internal/sync/eventcrypt.go`: hard wire-format cut to `enc.v2` (`envelopeVersion = 2`, Type sentinel `enc.v2`; v1 is dead — no decrypt path). The AAD now binds the full carrier tuple `u32len(ID)||ID || u32len(DeviceID)||DeviceID || u32len(kid)||kid || u64(Seq) || u64(HLC) || u64(epoch)` (big-endian, length-prefixed), with the kid derived from the sealing key (`KIDForWCK`) on both seal and open — the envelope's kid field stays an unauthenticated routing hint, so a hub-side relabel cannot wedge a decryptable event, while any carrier-field mutation (the `Seq=1` keyless soft-wedge, DeviceID re-attribution, HLC reordering) is now an AEAD authentication failure at decrypt time.
- `internal/state/store.go`: new `devstrap:event:v2` signature domain whose payload adds `device_id` + `seq`; local events sign v2 only, verification accepts v2 then falls back to v1 (re-founded hubs re-push v1-signed history verbatim; residual documented in spec/15).
- `internal/sync/encryptedhub.go` + `events.go`: a held-key AEAD failure no longer silently skips — Pull forwards the still-encrypted carrier (new `PullStats.Undecryptable`) and `ApplyEvents` quarantines it as a permanent `event_verification_failure` conflict of new kind `undecryptable` (never inserted, never `devices approve`-replayed, cursor advances past it, `hub gc` refuses while open). Retired `enc.v1` traffic is skipped with a loud "re-found the workspace on a fresh hub" warning. Remaining silent-skip classes (malformed envelope, anti-downgrade plaintext) stay scoped to open `P6-SYNC-02`.
- `internal/cli/hub.go`: the gc gate message now names the undecryptable count.
- Review fix (gpt-5.5 Major, dual review): the defer-vs-quarantine classification reads the untrusted kid hint, so a hostile hub could steer a not-yet-granted event into permanent quarantine by stripping/relabeling it. `ReplayUndecryptableConflicts` (+ `EncryptedHub.TryDecrypt`) now runs on every pull (`pullAndApplyEvents` — sync, run-loop, hub gc pre-sync): open undecryptable conflicts are re-attempted with the keys held then; on success the carrier applies through the normal verified path and the conflict auto-resolves (applied BEFORE the resolve so a transient DB failure leaves the conflict open for retry — the conflict dedup keys on (event ID, kind) so a post-decrypt signature failure still records a fresh verification row; a restored HLC still beyond trusted skew defers to a later cycle). Kid tampering can delay a not-yet-granted event, never destroy it. The replay is deliberately unconditional — any "hopeless, skip it" classification would read the same attacker-controlled kid field and reintroduce the loss (second reviewer's skip-exact-key refinement declined for this reason). Pinned by `TestReplayRecoversKidStrippedEventAfterGrant` + `TestReplayRecoveryUnblocksHashChainSuccessor` (the recovered event's hash-chain-held successors converge too). Second review Minor: the grant plane rides plaintext, so a legacy v1-signed grant's Seq is bound by neither AAD nor signature — residual now named precisely in spec/15 and the store.go comment.
- Specs: `spec/07` (envelope section + AD-3 break marked partially shipped), `spec/15` (threat + finding blocks marked mitigated/shipped; v1-signature residual documented); `sync_encrypted.txtar` pins the `enc.v2` sentinel on the hub file.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12 run` (0 issues); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (all green, incl. new `TestDecryptMutatedCarrierFails`, `TestEncryptedHubPoisonEventDoesNotWedge` rework, `TestEncryptedHubRetiredV1Skipped`, `TestApplyEventsQuarantinesUndecryptableCarrier`, `TestEventSignatureV2BindsDeviceIDAndSeq`); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` after commit.

Follow-ups:
- `P6-SYNC-02` (promote the remaining skip classes to first-class signals) and `P6-SEC-03` (transient-vs-permanent missing-epoch grace) stay open; `P4-SYNC-05` (folded hash chain) should build on the v2 signature domain.

## 2026-07-03 — CLAUDE.md: commit the model-selection policy for agent sessions

Changed:
- Committed the previously-local `CLAUDE.md` model-selection policy (cost/intelligence/taste rankings, delegation rules, Codex plugin command reference) plus field notes from the Pass 6 P2 wave: `codex:codex-rescue` as the direct wrapper for ordinary delegation, line-level written specs as the reliability lever, dual-review yield on small PRs, SendMessage nudges for idle subagents, and per-job worktrees for parallel Codex runs.
- Docs only; no behavior/code change.

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-03 — AGENTS.md rewrite: concise branch/worktree/PR guidance

Changed:
- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` from dense paragraph-bullets into three scannable sections (Branches & worktrees, PR cycle, GitHub access), preserving every existing rule and codifying the operational lessons from the Pass 6 P1 + P2-quick-win waves: fetch-first because local `main` is routinely stale (read status/code via `git show origin/main:`), disposable worktrees based on `origin/main` with post-merge cleanup, the exact working lint invocation fallback, reply-AND-resolve for every review thread (CodeRabbit blocks auto-merge otherwise), `gh pr merge --squash --auto`, the ledger open-count-equals-row-count invariant, and serial-merge/rebase discipline for multi-PR waves (including the leftover-conflict-marker check before `rebase --continue`).
- No behavior/code change; docs only.

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (work-log entry present); no Go changes, `go build ./...` clean.

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-07-03 — P6-GIT-05: clean orphan worktrees after post-add failures (P2 quick-win wave)

Changed:
- `createFreshWorktree` now removes the just-created checkout and deletes its `agent/...` branch when LFS policy handling, current-device lookup, or SQLite worktree insertion fails after `git worktree add`. Dual-review hardening (opus-4.8 Minor + CodeRabbit Major): both cleanup sites share one `removeOrphanWorktree` helper that runs under `context.WithoutCancel` with a 2-minute bound — the failure being cleaned up may itself be a cancellation, and the same cancelled ctx would no-op both git commands and leak the exact orphan the fix targets — and surfaces `WorktreeRemove`/`branch -D`/`MarkWorktreeRemoved` failures as warnings instead of swallowing them, so an operator knows manual cleanup is needed.
- LFS pull failures now include the worktree path in the user-facing error.
- `agent run` file-policy denial cleanup now deletes the just-created branch in addition to removing the worktree and marking the DB row removed.
- Added CLI regression coverage for LFS-pull failure and SQLite insert failure paths, asserting no checkout directory and no `agent/*` branch remain.
- Updated specs 08, 10, and 16 to document the cleanup guarantee and coverage; ledger `docs/audits/README.md` (P6-GIT-05 → *Recently shipped*).
- Model policy note (CLAUDE.md): implementation + tests delegated to gpt-5.5 (Codex) against a written line-level spec; diff reviewed line-by-line and accepted (the failure-injection tests — fake-git PATH shim + SQLite BEFORE INSERT trigger — are hermetic and cover both post-add failure classes).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- None for P6-GIT-05. The doctor orphan-worktree check remains deliberately out of scope for this change.

## 2026-07-03 — P6-CLI-02: gate `scan --adopt` on the workspace root (P2 quick-win wave)

Changed:
- `internal/cli/scan.go`: when `--adopt` is set, the scanned root must equal the workspace root — otherwise the command refuses with `exitUsage` and an actionable message ("scan without --adopt to inspect, or use 'devstrap add' for a single repo"). Adoption emits signed fleet-wide `project.added` events that every device joins to its own managed root, so `devstrap scan ~/Downloads --adopt` could silently rewrite the fleet namespace and make every peer eagerly blobless-clone out-of-tree repos on its next sync. Read-only scans of arbitrary directories are unchanged. Dual-review hardening (Codex, Minor): the root comparison resolves symlinks (`sameResolvedDir`) so an alias of the real workspace root is accepted — adoption then proceeds under the canonical root spelling — while case-folding is deliberately omitted (over-refusal is the safe direction on case-insensitive filesystems).
- Model policy note (CLAUDE.md): implementation + tests delegated to gpt-5.5 (Codex) against a written line-level spec; diff reviewed line-by-line and accepted. Docs/ledger authored directly.
- Specs: 13 (scan contract line + P6-CLI-02 section → shipped), 16 (test inventory), 18 (this entry); ledger `docs/audits/README.md` (P6-CLI-02 → *Recently shipped*).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- New tests: `TestScanAdoptRefusesNonWorkspaceRoot` (exitUsage appError, zero projects adopted afterwards), `TestScanAdoptExplicitWorkspaceRootSucceeds` (positional root equal to the workspace root still adopts), `TestScanAdoptAcceptsSymlinkedWorkspaceRoot` (alias accepted; canonical local paths), `TestScanReadOnlyAllowsNonWorkspaceRoot` (inspection of foreign directories keeps working).

Follow-ups:
- `P6-CLI-01` (re-init root-change split-brain) is the sibling guard, deferred to the next cycle; subtree adoption (rebasing `finding.Path` against the workspace root) remains a documented future option.

## 2026-07-03 — P6-DATA-02: per-project env rotation clear (P2 quick-win wave)

Changed:
- Fixed `Store.ClearRotationForProject` to clear `secret_bindings.needs_rotation` through `namespace_entries.env_profile_id` instead of the non-existent `env_profiles.namespace_id` column — the one-arg `devstrap env rotate <path>` form failed on every invocation with `no such column: namespace_id`; only `--all` worked.
- Added store coverage proving per-project clearing returns the selected project's binding count and leaves other projects flagged (`TestClearRotationForProject`).
- Added CLI coverage for one-arg `devstrap env rotate <path>` succeeding and printing the per-project cleared-binding count (`TestEnvRotateProjectClearsRotationFlag`).
- Updated the P6-DATA-02 spec notes in `spec/09_SECRETS_AND_ENVIRONMENT.md` and `spec/12_DATA_MODEL_SQLITE.md` from open defect to shipped fix, and moved the audit-ledger row out of the open backlog.
- Model policy note (CLAUDE.md): implementation + tests delegated to gpt-5.5 (Codex) against a written line-level spec; the diff (including the unrequested-but-convention-consistent spec/ledger updates) was reviewed line-by-line in the main loop and accepted.
- Ledger arithmetic reconciliation (CodeRabbit on PR #39): the Pass 6 header count and the open-table rows used different semantics (fully-applied `P6-DOC-02`/`P6-DOC-03` still sat in the open table while the header excluded them). The fully-applied doc rows moved to *Recently shipped*, and the header now equals the row count by construction (33 open of 43 = 43 − 8 shipped − 2 fully-applied doc fixes; `P6-DOC-01`/`P6-DOC-04` stay open for their test-hardening residuals).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- Add a CI lint that prepares static store queries against a migrated in-memory database (the audit's stretch item; deferred to keep this PR minimal).

## 2026-07-03 — P6-SYNC-03: sticky fail-closed enrollment window (P2 quick-win wave)

Changed:
- `internal/state`: `hasEnrolledDevices` now counts `trust_state IN ('approved','revoked','lost')` instead of `'approved'` only. A revoked/lost row proves an operator trust decision happened, so revoking (or losing) the last approved device keeps `verifyEventSignature` fail-closed instead of silently reopening the pre-enrollment fail-open regime — previously the revoked device (and even unknown/unsigned devices) could inject non-destructive `project.added`/`draft.snapshot.created`/`conflict.resolved` events again. Auto-created `pending` placeholders (`EnsureRemoteDeviceTx`) still don't count, and the genuinely-never-enrolled bootstrap window (`P4-SEC-04`) is unchanged. Post-revoke traffic lands in the shipped `P6-SYNC-01` per-event quarantine (one `event_verification_failure` conflict per event; cursor advances; no batch abort).
- Model policy note (CLAUDE.md): implemented directly in the main loop (fable-5) — one-line predicate but trust-boundary semantics; PRs 1/3/4 of the wave (`P6-DATA-02`/`P6-GIT-05`/`P6-CLI-02`) are delegated to gpt-5.5 (Codex) per policy.
- Specs: 07 (P6-SYNC-03 section rewritten as shipped; AD-6 bullet marked shipped), 15 (fail-closed reality paragraph now documents sticky enrollment; related-threat rows updated), 14 (P2 quick-win wave status), 16 (test inventory), 18 (this entry); ledger `docs/audits/README.md` (P6-SYNC-03 → *Recently shipped*; Pass 6 now 33 open of 43).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- New tests: `TestHasEnrolledDevicesStickyAfterRevoke` (`internal/state`: local-only → open; pending placeholder → still open; approved → closed; revoked/lost last approved → stays closed) and `TestApplyEventsRevokedLastDeviceStaysFailClosed` (`internal/sync`: with only a revoked device on record, a validly-signed event from it and an unknown-device event both quarantine — Quarantined=2, nothing applied, cursor advances).

Follow-ups:
- Synced `device.revoked` trust propagation (revoke is still local-only) — carried from the P6-SYNC-01 residuals.
- Rest of the P2 quick-win wave: `P6-DATA-02`, `P6-GIT-05`, `P6-CLI-02`.

## 2026-07-03 — P6-GIT-01: git timeout split by command class; deadline kills are terminal (PR 3/3 — completes the Pass 6 P1 wave)

Changed:
- `internal/git`: new `Runner.LongTimeout` (default 30m) — the per-**attempt** deadline for the network-transfer command class (`CloneWithOptions`, `Fetch`/`runWithNetworkRetry`, `LFSPull`) via `longTransferContext` (a caller-supplied ctx deadline always wins; `LongTimeout <= 0` opts out); every other command keeps the 2m `Timeout`. Per-attempt (not whole-loop) so a slow failed transfer cannot starve a retry after a genuine transient network error.
- A self-imposed `context.DeadlineExceeded` is now the distinct terminal **`ErrTimeout`** (was retryable `ErrNetwork`), with the message pointing at `materialization.clone_timeout` — the retry loops retry only `ErrNetwork`, so the triple wipe-and-retry of a >2-minute blobless clone is gone and the staging destination survives untouched. The timeout label uses the actual effective deadline, not the 2m default.
- `internal/cli`: `materialization.clone_timeout` config key (viper `GetDuration`, `SetDefault "30m"` in `root.go`; documented in spec/08's shipped-config-keys line) and a `gitRunner(opts)` helper that stamps `LongTimeout`; all network-relevant `dsgit.NewRunner()` call sites in hydrate/worktree/agent switched to it (`hydrate --lfs` now routes through `LFSPull` so it gets the long deadline). `agentDiffSummary` intentionally keeps the bare runner (local status/diff only, commented). `ErrTimeout` maps to the network exit code.
- Delegation note (CLAUDE.md model policy): implementation delegated to gpt-5.5 (Codex); the job completed its file changes but its runtime died before reporting (zombie "running" record cancelled via the companion CLI). The on-disk diff was reviewed line-by-line against the written spec in the main loop and accepted; docs authored directly.
- Specs: 08 (P6-GIT-01 section → shipped; config-keys line), 13 (via spec/08 cross-refs), 14 (P1-wave status — all five P1s closed), 16 (test inventory), 18 (this entry); ledger `docs/audits/README.md` (P6-GIT-01 → *Recently shipped*; Pass 6 now 34 open of 43, zero open P1s).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- New tests: `TestRunTimesOutAndReportsTimeoutError` (renamed; `ErrTimeout` kind + message), `TestCloneTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetryOrWipe` (attempt-count file proves exactly one attempt; sentinel file proves no wipe), `TestCloneUsesLongTimeoutInsteadOfShortTimeout` (long class ignores the short cap), `TestFetchTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetry`, `TestLFSPullTimeoutIsTerminalAndDoesNotRetry`, `ExitCodeWithWriter(ErrTimeout)`, and `gitRunner` config/default round-trips.

- Dual-review hardening (independent opus-4.8 + Codex passes on the PR; both independently flagged the push gap) fixed four findings: (1) `pushAgentBranch`'s `gitRunner` switch was inert — plain `Run` never reads `LongTimeout` — and a large `agent pr` push stayed 2m-capped; new `Runner.PushBranch` puts push in the transfer class; (2) the "raise materialization.clone_timeout" hint fired on every timeout, misdirecting non-transfer commands — it is now scoped to the transfer class via a context marker; (3) an explicit `clone_timeout: 0` silently reintroduced the 2m cap — the marked class with `LongTimeout <= 0` now runs unbounded; (4) documented that any deadline expiry (including a caller's) is terminal while cancellation still classifies normally. Pinned by `TestPushBranchTimeoutIsTerminalWithHint`, `TestZeroLongTimeoutMeansUnboundedTransfer`, and the no-hint assertion in `TestRunTimesOutAndReportsTimeoutError`. Signed-off trade-off (spec/08): a hard-hung transfer is now detected at 30m instead of ~6m and can hold a materialize worker slot that long — the accepted cost of letting slow-but-progressing transfers finish; `http.lowSpeedLimit/Time` noted as the hang-vs-slow follow-up.

Follow-ups:
- Pass 6 P2 wave next (quick wins first: `P6-DATA-02`, `P6-GIT-05`, `P6-SYNC-03`, `P6-CLI-02`); `P6-GIT-04` should give materialize-path LFS pulls the same `LongTimeout`.

## 2026-07-02 — P6-HUB-01: hub gc is sync-first, grace-windowed, and refuses to sweep when blind (PR 2/3 of the P1 wave)

Changed:
- **Pre-GC sync gate:** `hubGC` now runs the pull half of a sync cycle first, via the new `pullAndApplyEvents` helper factored out of `runSyncCycle` (`internal/cli/sync.go`) — cursor-based pull, `ApplyEventsWithStats`, low-water-mark cursor advance — so every device's `draft.snapshot.created` events enter the mark set before any deletion.
- **Refuse-to-sweep when blind:** `EncryptedHub.PullStats` gains `Truncated` (events deferred at an epoch/kid truncate) and `Skipped` (malformed/undecryptable/anti-downgrade drops) counters, reset per pull; `ApplyEventsWithStats` (new; `ApplyEvents` delegates to it, no call-site churn) reports `Quarantined` and `CursorHeld`. `hubGC` aborts with a non-zero exit and remedy text if any of those fire this cycle or if any quarantine-class conflict is still open (`dssync.QuarantineConflictTypes`; the skew/hash-chain literals are now exported constants).
- **Age grace window:** `hub gc --grace-window` (default 24h) keeps unreferenced blobs younger than the window — a device pushes its blob BEFORE its referencing event, so a fresh blob may be legitimately reference-less for one push cycle. Backed by the `Hub.ListBlobs` → `[]BlobInfo{Key, LastModified}` interface change threaded through `S3Client.ListObjectsV2`/`S3Adapter` (from `out.Contents[i].LastModified`), `FileHub` (blob mtime), `EncryptedHub`, memS3, and `recordingHub`; a zero `LastModified` is treated as young (kept). `hub gc` help documents single-designated-device operation; the S3 conditional-write sweep lock and signed retention marker stay open (`P4-HUB-12`/`P6-HUB-04`).
- The PR-1 e2e script now passes `--grace-window=0` so its retention assertion stays pinned to the `draft_snapshots` reference, not the window.
- Specs: 03 (P6-HUB-01 section → shipped), 13 (`hub gc` flags + sync-first/refusal/grace semantics), 14 (P1-wave status), 16 (test inventory), 18 (this entry); ledger `docs/audits/README.md` (P6-HUB-01 → *Recently shipped*; remaining P1 is `P6-GIT-01`).
- Model policy note (CLAUDE.md): the mechanical `LastModified` interface threading was delegated to gpt-5.5 (Codex) against a written spec and reviewed line-by-line; the gate design/implementation, test scenarios, and docs were authored directly.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.
- New/extended tests: `PullStats` assertions in the missing-epoch/unheld-kid/unknown-version hub tests; `ApplyEventsWithStats` assertions in the revoked-quarantine (Quarantined=1, cursor advances) and hash-chain (CursorHeld) tests; `TestHubGCRefusesOnOpenQuarantineConflict` (refusal, nothing deleted); `TestHubGCGraceWindowKeepsFreshBlobs` (fresh kept, aged reclaimed); e2e `hub_gc_stale_marks.txtar` (founder A runs `hub gc --grace-window=0` while stale; the pre-GC pull applies joiner B's snapshot event and B's blob survives).

- Dual-review hardening (independent fable-5 + Codex review passes on the PR) fixed four findings: (1) the pre-GC pull consumed events without caching their referenced blobs — the cursor had advanced, so a draft first seen by gc could never materialize; `hubGC` now runs `pullReferencedBlobs` exactly like `sync` (the e2e script asserts the gc device extracts the other device's draft content afterwards); (2) a skew-quarantined event that later applies now auto-resolves its `untrustworthy_remote_time` conflict in the same transaction (`ResolveConflictByFingerprint`; pinned by `TestApplyResolvesSkewConflictOnLateApply`) — previously one transient clock hiccup blocked gc fleet-wide until a manual `conflicts resolve`; (3) `ErrSnapshotRequired` from the pre-GC pull now maps to the network exit code, matching `sync`; (4) a cursor-held refusal gets its own message ("re-run after a later sync applies it") since `conflicts resolve` cannot clear a hold. Docs honesty: the grace window **bounds** the blob-before-event race to the window rather than closing it (offline-past-window devices re-push on recovery; a dedup'd `PutBlob` does not refresh `LastModified` — both tracked with `P4-HUB-12`), and `--dry-run` is documented as not read-only (it runs the converging pull).

Follow-ups:
- PR 3/3: `P6-GIT-01` (per-command-class git timeouts, terminal deadline kills). Then `P6-HUB-04` (signed retention marker) and the sweep lock + dedup-`PutBlob` timestamp refresh (`P4-HUB-12`).

## 2026-07-02 — P6-DATA-01: origin records its own draft_snapshots row atomically at create time (PR 1/3 of the P1 wave)

Changed:
- Extracted `Store.InsertLocalEvent`'s stamping body into the exported `Store.InsertLocalEventTx(ctx, tx, event)` (behavior-preserving: pre-stamp defaults, HLC/seq stamp, prev-hash backfill, signature, `ErrDivergentEvent` on duplicate); `InsertLocalEvent` is now a thin `WithTx` wrapper.
- `draft snapshot create` (`internal/cli/draft.go`) and the revoke-rewrap `emitSupersedingDraftSnapshot` (`internal/cli/blob_gc.go`) now insert the `draft.snapshot.created` event and the origin's own `draft_snapshots` row in **one SQLite transaction** (`InsertLocalEventTx` + `tx.RecordDraftSnapshotTx`), closing the P1 data-loss path where routine `sync` local GC + `hub gc` deleted the origin's only bundle copy (the apply path never re-applies the origin's own event, `events.go` `if !inserted`).
- `DraftSnapshotRef` gained `NamespaceID` (SELECT/Scan in `DraftSnapshotsForBlobRef`) so the rewrap path can record the superseding row; the P5-SEC-01 event-before-repoint ordering is unchanged.
- Ledger reconciliation (`docs/audits/README.md`, convention #3): moved shipped `P6-SYNC-01`, `P6-SEC-01`, `P6-SEC-02` (PRs #30–#34) and `P6-DATA-01` to *Recently shipped*; Pass 6 now 36 open of 43, remaining P1s `P6-HUB-01`/`P6-GIT-01`. Corrected spec/14's stale `P6-SEC-01` "remain open" status (b/c shipped in #33/#34).
- Specs: 07 (snapshot flow step 7 records the origin row atomically), 12 (`draft_snapshots` defect note → shipped; P6-DATA-01 section rewritten as shipped), 14 (P1-wave statuses), 16 (test inventory), 18 (this entry).
- Model policy note (CLAUDE.md): implementation + tests delegated to gpt-5.5 (Codex rescue) against a written line-level spec; diff reviewed line-by-line and accepted. Docs/ledger authored directly.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal` (clean), `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state ./internal/cli ./internal/sync ./cmd/devstrap/...`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` (all green).
- New tests: `TestInsertLocalEventTxMatchesInsertLocalEvent` (wrapper/Tx parity: stamping, seq/HLC advance, prev-hash chain, divergent duplicate), `TestDraftSnapshotCreateRecordsOriginSnapshotRow` (`LatestDraftSnapshot` non-nil + `RetainedBlobRefs` includes the ref immediately after create), `TestRewrapDraftBlobRecordsOriginSupersedingSnapshot` (superseding row recorded, `DraftBlobRefs` carries the new ref), e2e `draft_snapshot_gc_retains_origin.txtar` (create → `sync --hub-file` → `hub gc` on the origin → blob survives locally and on the hub, `deleted 0`, no conflicts).

Follow-ups:
- PR 2/3: `P6-HUB-01` (sync-first, grace-windowed, refuse-to-sweep `hub gc`); PR 3/3: `P6-GIT-01` (per-command-class git timeouts, terminal deadline kills).

## 2026-07-02 — Post-#33 review hardening: kid-as-hint decrypt, replay-time grant ingestion, Prime custody guard (PR-3c)

Changed:
- **Kid is now a candidate-ordering hint, never a candidate filter** (`EncryptedHub.Pull`; fable-5 review, Major): the envelope kid is outside the AAD until `enc.v2`, so a hostile hub could relabel a genuinely decryptable event's kid to an unheld value and wedge the device forever on the truncate path — even though it held the decrypting key. `Pull` now tries the exact-kid match first and then every held key at the epoch; it truncates (defers) only when the kid is unheld AND nothing at the epoch decrypts (preserving the P6-SEC-02 fleet-key defer), and skips only when the named key is held (or the envelope is legacy kid-less) and all candidates fail auth. Pinned by `TestEncryptedHubRelabeledKidStillDecrypts`; all prior poison/truncate pins unchanged. The remaining kid-STRIP lever (drops an event a targeted not-yet-granted joiner can't decrypt) is documented in spec/15 as the `enc.v2`/`P6-SYNC-04` residual, and the overclaiming comment in `eventcrypt.go` is corrected.
- Split-brain double-founding (fable-5, Minor) documented in spec/07: two founder-role devices racing an empty hub both found and defer on each other until mutual approval; use `init --join` on second machines.
- The gpt-5.5 (Codex) review of merged PR #33 returned four findings; two were real gaps fixed here, two are the already-documented residuals (`P4-SEC-04` bootstrap-window grants — now with an explicit note that they gain `'grant'` origin and push preference; `P6-SEC-03` truncate wedge — now noting the forged-kid variant), annotated in spec/15 and spec/07.
- **Replay-time grant ingestion** (`internal/cli/devices.go`): a quarantined `device.key.granted` carrier is only WCK-ingested by `EncryptedHub.Pull`, which already advanced past it and never re-pulls; `replayQuarantinedEvents` (approve/enroll-approve) now unmarshals a replayed grant and calls `Keyring.IngestGrant`, so the granted `(epoch, kid)` is recovered instead of being permanently lost (fleet events sealed under it would otherwise defer forever). Pinned by `TestReplayIngestsQuarantinedGrant` (grant quarantined under the fail-closed regime → approve → epoch/custody/decrypt-candidates all held, conflict resolved).
- **Prime legacy-upgrade custody guard** (`internal/workspacekeys/keyring.go`): the legacy kid-less backfill now byte-compares an existing kid-aware custody slot before `StoreWCK` and refuses a mismatch — the same P6-SEC-01b defense `IngestGrant` has; previously the upgrade was the one surviving unconditional custody write. Pinned by `TestPrimeRefusesLegacyUpgradeOverDifferentBytes`.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- `P6-SEC-03` bounded grace window (now also covering forged kids); `P4-SEC-04` out-of-band fingerprint confirmation.

## 2026-07-02 — P6-SEC-01(b/c) + P6-SEC-02: (epoch, kid)-addressed workspace keys (PR-3b, completes the hub-trust workstream)

Changed:
- Migration `00014_workspace_key_kids.sql`: `workspace_keys` re-keyed to PK `(workspace_id, epoch, kid)` with a new `origin` column (`self`/`grant`/`legacy`, CHECK-constrained); pre-kid rows backfill as `kid=''`/`origin='legacy'`; `workspace_key_grants` gains a nullable audit `kid`. Down is lossy (documented in the header). Schema version is now 14; the planned gitstate mirror migration renumbers to 00015.
- `kid = hex(sha256(wck))` — the **full digest** (64 lowercase hex), per the spec/07 AD-3 direction, not the audit's 8-byte prefix (a short prefix would leave a 2^64 preimage-prefix aliasing vector on the custody slot). `KIDForWCK` lives in `internal/sync`; the kid rides `DeviceKeyGrant` and the `enc.v1` envelope as optional JSON fields (outside the AAD for wire compat — moving it into the AAD is the `enc.v2` break, P6-SYNC-04). A stripped/forged kid can only cause a decrypt miss or auth failure, never wrong-key acceptance.
- `internal/workspacekeys.Keyring`: cache keyed by `(epoch, kid)` with origin tracking. `IngestGrant` computes the kid from the unwrapped bytes, rejects a carried-kid mismatch, byte-compares before any same-slot custody rewrite, and **never overwrites** — a colliding key lands in its own slot (P6-SEC-01b). New `PushKey` selects the highest epoch preferring `grant` > `self` > `legacy` origin, so a legacy self-minted joiner converges onto the founder's fleet key (P6-SEC-01c via the `origin` write-path record); `GrantAllEpochs` forwards the same preferred key per epoch. `Prime` lazily upgrades legacy kid-less keys (computes kid, re-stores custody kid-aware, rewrites the metadata row via `UpdateKeyKid`).
- `internal/sync.WorkspaceKeyring` interface: `PushKey(ctx) (epoch, kid, wck, err)` replaces the push-side `CurrentEpoch`+`WCK(epoch)` pair; `WCKCandidates(epoch, kid)` replaces `WCK(epoch)` (kid `""` = try every held key at the epoch — legacy envelope fallback). `EncryptedHub.Pull` now **truncates (defers) on an unheld kid at a held epoch** — the fleet-key-vs-self-mint collision — instead of skipping, so fleet events are never permanently jumped by a legacy device; a decrypt failure on held candidates still skips.
- `internal/devicekeys`: kid-aware WCK custody — `wck.<ws>.<epoch>.<kid>` keychain accounts and `wck-<ws>-<epoch>-<kid>.key` file slots, legacy kid-less forms preserved; kid validated (64 lowercase hex or empty) at every entry point before touching an account name or path.
- `internal/state`: `RecordKeyEpoch(epoch, kid, origin)`, new `HeldKeys`/`UpdateKeyKid`, `HeldKeyEpochs` now DISTINCT, kid threaded through `RecordKeyGrant`/`RecordKeyGrantTx`.
- Tests: keyring same-epoch coexistence + grant-preferred `PushKey` (warm and cold), kid-mismatch rejection, empty-keyring `PushKey` → epoch 0, legacy backfill upgrade, concurrent same-epoch rotate no-clobber; `KIDForWCK` + envelope-kid pins; hub poison tests split into forged-kid/legacy-kid-less skips vs. the new `TestEncryptedHubUnheldKidTruncates` defer pin; devicekeys kid round-trips + invalid-kid rejection; state migration/backfill/idempotency tests; forged-grant CLI test hardened to glob both custody filename forms.
- Model policy note (CLAUDE.md): the mechanical layer (migration/store/devicekeys) was delegated per policy, but the delegate implemented it directly as a Claude agent instead of routing through Codex/gpt-5.5; output was reviewed line-by-line against the written spec and accepted (judge the output, not the price tag).
- Specs: 07 (Pull kid semantics, AD-3 items marked shipped, P6-SEC-02 kid section rewritten as shipped), 09 (kid-aware WCK custody keying), 12 (00014 schema + version 14), 15 (SEC-01 steps b/c marked shipped; coordinated-break list updated), 16 (test inventory), 18 (this entry).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `golangci-lint run`, `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`, `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`.

Follow-ups:
- `enc.v2` AAD binding (`ID || DeviceID || Seq || HLC || epoch || kid`, P6-SYNC-04), skip-forward on never-granted epochs (P6-SEC-03), composite cursor/skipped-event replay (P6-SYNC-02) — all have their seams in place.

## 2026-07-02 — P6-SEC-02: founder/join split (PR 3/3 of the hub-trust workstream)

Changed:
- `init` no longer mints a workspace key. It records `role: founder` (default) or `role: joiner` (`--join`) in config.yaml. Founding is deferred to the first `sync`.
- `runSyncCycle` now **pulls before it pushes** and runs the push behind a founder/join gate (`pushLocalEventsGated`): a keyless device founds (mints epoch 1) only when the hub is genuinely empty (pull AND push cursors both 0 and `EncryptedHub.PullStats.RawSeen == 0`) and it did not `init --join`; otherwise it DEFERS the push (local events stay queued behind an unadvanced push cursor, re-push once approved and granted). This closes the SEC-02 data loss: a joining device never seals its pre-approval events under a self-minted, never-granted WCK. `drainPendingHubDeletes` stays after the push (P5-PROD-02).
- Added `EncryptedHub.Stats *PullStats` (RawSeen) so the gate can tell an empty hub (found) from a populated hub a joiner cannot yet decrypt (wait for grant); `hubFromOptions` allocates it. Updated the `Push` epoch-0 error text.
- Dual-review hardening (both reviewers flagged it): the defensive `EnsureBootstrap` in `grantWorkspaceKeyToApprovedDevice` is now **founder-gated** — a `--join` joiner that approves another device before being granted the fleet key no longer self-mints (it warns and grants nothing). This closes the last command path by which a joiner could self-mint, making "a joiner never self-mints" airtight in this PR. Pinned by `TestJoinerApprovingAnotherDeviceDoesNotSelfMint`.
- Post-CI review hardening (CodeRabbit, Major): the founding gate additionally requires the **pull cursor** to be 0 — `RawSeen == 0` alone only proves "nothing new after the pull cursor", so a keyless device whose pull cursor had already advanced (e.g. past events that all quarantined as permanent verification failures) could otherwise found a divergent epoch-1 key on a populated hub. Pinned by `TestFounderGateRequiresPullCursorZero`.
- Scope: this PR is the founder/join half of the SEC-02 fix. The `(epoch,kid)` keying + `IngestGrant` overwrite-refusal (which also completes `P6-SEC-01` steps b/c and the concurrent-`Rotate` collision) are deferred to a tracked follow-up (PR-3b) to keep the schema migration + interface change separate from the data-loss fix; with founding deferred a fresh joiner never self-mints, so the primary SEC-02 vector is closed here.
- Specs: 07 (Init/Pull lifecycle + P6-SEC-02 section marked founder/join-shipped), 13 (`init --join`, sync pull-then-push + awaiting-grant output), 15 (AD-3 founder/join marked shipped), 16 (test inventory).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` (0 issues); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...`.
- New tests: `init`/`init --join` write the correct role and hint (`init_join_test.go`); e2e `sync_join_flow.txtar` (founder mints on empty hub and pushes; `--join` device adds+syncs pre-approval → `pushed 0` + `Awaiting workspace key grant`, nothing on the hub; after approval its project pushes and materializes on the founder; hub ciphertext throughout).

Follow-ups:
- PR-3b: `(epoch,kid)` keying + `IngestGrant` overwrite-refusal (`P6-SEC-01` b/c, `P6-SEC-02` residual, concurrent-`Rotate` collision).

## 2026-07-02 — P6-SEC-01(a): verify grant carriers before WCK ingestion (PR 2/3 of the hub-trust workstream)

Changed:
- Added a `Verify func(ctx, state.Event) error` seam to `EncryptedHub`; `Pull` now verifies each `device.key.granted` carrier **before** calling `IngestGrant`, skipping (never ingesting) on failure. `hubFromOptions` wires it to the new exported `(*state.Store).VerifyRemoteEvent`, which delegates to `verifyEventSignature` — so a grant forged by an unknown/unapproved/bad-signature device is refused once any device is enrolled, and the refused carrier still flows to `ApplyEvents` and lands in the PR-1 `event_verification_failure` quarantine. Trust regime is identical to the apply path; the pre-enrollment bootstrap window (`P4-SEC-04`) is the only residual open-ingest path. `Verify == nil` preserves prior behavior for decryption-only unit tests.
- Closes P6-SEC-01 step (a). Steps (b) held-epoch overwrite refusal and (c) verified-epoch gating of `CurrentKeyEpoch` are structurally delivered by PR 3/3's `(epoch,kid)` keying + founder/join split (a legacy self-minted epoch-1 must stay displaceable until then).
- Dual-review hardening: `VerifyRemoteEvent` now runs the content-hash self-consistency check in addition to `verifyEventSignature`, so the pre-ingest gate rejects exactly the apply-path permanent-failure set — the keyring can never advance from a carrier `ApplyEvents` would quarantine. (Reviewers also noted the pre-enrollment bootstrap window still open-ingests grants; that is the intended, documented `P4-SEC-04` residual — closing it now would break legitimate joining before PR-3's founder/join split, so it is left as-is and called out in spec/07/15.)
- Specs: 00 (implemented inventory), 07 (Pull now documents pre-ingest verification), 12 (non-inserting verifier seam), 14 (P6 backlog status), 15 (P6-SEC-01 threat + finding sections marked step-a-shipped with the acceptance test), 16 (test inventory).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` (0 issues); `go run ./cmd/spec-drift`; `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...`.
- New tests: `EncryptedHub.Pull` refuses/ingests/nil-verifier back-compat; `TestVerifyRemoteEventMatchesInsertEventRegime` ({local, approved+valid, forged sig, revoked, unknown} × {enrolled, not}); `TestVerifyRemoteEventRejectsContentHashMismatch`; malicious-hub acceptance `TestSyncRejectsForgedGrantBeforeWCKIngest` (forged grant at epoch 2^40 wrapped to the victim's own recipient → `CurrentKeyEpoch` unchanged, no WCK file written, one quarantine conflict).

Follow-ups:
- PR 3/3: P6-SEC-02 founder/join split + `(epoch,kid)` keying (completes SEC-01 b/c and closes the pre-enrollment open-ingest window).

## 2026-07-02 — P6-SYNC-01: per-event verification quarantine (PR 1/3 of the hub-trust workstream)

Changed:
- Added the `state.ErrEventVerification` sentinel and `%w`-wrapped it into the six permanent verification failure paths (content-hash mismatch in `insertEvent`; unknown device, missing signing key, missing signature ×2, non-approved trust state, and invalid Ed25519 signature in `verifyEventSignature`); infrastructure/DB errors deliberately stay non-matching so they still abort the batch.
- `ApplyEvents` now quarantines `ErrEventVerification`/`ErrDivergentEvent` per-event as `event_verification_failure` conflicts (new `ConflictEventVerification` type) and continues the batch without lowering the low-water-mark cursor — one bad signed event (e.g. from a revoked device) can no longer wedge every other device's sync. Conflict details carry the full marshaled `state.Event` (`event_json`) so replay works without re-pulling; the existing stable-details dedup absorbs repeated pulls.
- `devices approve` now replays that device's quarantined events via the new `replayQuarantinedEvents` (new store helper `OpenConflictsByType`), resolving conflicts whose events apply after approval.
- Specs: 00 (implemented inventory), 07 (cursor semantics + P6-SYNC-01 section rewritten to shipped-status), 12 (conflict payload docs), 13 (approve replay + synced `device.revoked` future work), 14 (P1 wave status), 15 (new mitigated threat row), 16 (test inventory).

- Dual-review hardening (independent Claude + Codex review passes before merge) fixed six findings: (1) quarantined events now count as consumed for the cursor so a batch *ending* in one is not re-delivered forever by the inclusive pull boundary; (2) `insertEvent` verifies signature/trust **before** the prev-hash chain check so a revoked device's chained events (seq N, N+1) fail permanent instead of surfacing as a transient cursor-holding `ErrEventHashChain` wedge; (3) conflict details carry a machine-readable `kind` and approval replay skips `divergent` rows (a replay would "succeed" only because the original event exists); (4) `devices enroll --approve` now replays like `approve` (the realistic first-contact ordering); (5) conflicts dedup by event ID, not volatile error text; (6) `conflicts list/show` scrub token-shaped values from attacker-influenced details before display.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` (0 issues); `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...`; new e2e `sync_revoked_quarantine.txtar` (three devices; revoked C pushes; A syncs exit 0 with one quarantine conflict) plus unit tests for sentinel coverage, quarantine/dedup/cursor advance, trailing-quarantine cursor, chained-revoked-events no-wedge, approve/enroll replay, and divergent-skip.

Follow-ups:
- P6-SEC-01(a) verifier seam on `EncryptedHub.Pull` (PR 2/3) and P6-SEC-02 founder/join + `(epoch,kid)` keying (PR 3/3).
- Synced `device.revoked` trust propagation (revoke is still local-only) and the P6-SYNC-03 sticky-enrollment predicate.
- Bounded aggregation for quarantine conflicts from a still-pushing revoked device (one open row per distinct poisoned event today).

## 2026-07-01 — Sixth-pass spec revision (verification + architecture direction)

Changed:
- Re-verified every one of the 43 sixth-pass audit findings (`docs/audits/AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-07-01_PASS6.md`) against the code via a verification-driven multi-agent workflow (nine dimension verifiers, each adversarially re-opening the cited `file:line` evidence and trying to refute the claim): **all 43 CONFIRMED, none refuted, all OSS-aligned** — 28 ready to implement as written, 15 needing design (the `P6-SEC-*`/`P6-SYNC-01/02/04`/`P6-HUB-*` crypto-and-sync cluster, plus `P6-DATA-04`, `P6-XP-02/03/04`). No new code changed; the findings remain open backlog for future implementation PRs.
- Ran a four-lens viability brainstorm (product / technical-risk / OSS-sustainability / AI-agent-fit) and a full 20-file spec review (109 issues), anchored by six exa-backed best-practice topics (local-first sync engines, E2E multi-device key management, Go CLI distribution, multi-repo workspace tools, agent worktree isolation, object-store logs).
- Revised **all 20 spec files** (spec/00–17, 19, adr/0001): applied the 109 code-verified staleness/contradiction fixes (shipped-vs-planned honesty for run-loop, eager materialize, cursor-based pull, conflicts CLI, fail-closed HUB-03, forge doctor probes, draft caps, `deriveDisplayStatus`, live R2 adapter; corrected broken/nonexistent command examples `env bind`/`promote`/`export`/`env check`; fixed `sync_cursors`↔`hub_cursors`, schema/index inventories, `--hub-file` test-vs-user framing). 151 edits total across the clusters.
- **De-personalized the corpus for the OSS audience** (OSS-alignment): removed every personal-environment leak — `work/nclh/foc-models`→`work/acme/api`, `/Users/artem`/`artem-main`, author hardware fleets (Mac Minis / GMKtec Ubuntu box / graphics laptop / NAS), and the employer stack in examples (`SNOWFLAKE_*`, `python-uv-snowflake`, `op://Engineering/Snowflake`, `~/.snowflake/**` deny rules, `gss-agent`) → vendor-neutral names. Zero residual leaks remain (grep-verified).
- **Recorded 8 validated architecture-direction decisions** as clearly future-facing DIRECTION sections (never as shipped), cross-referencing finding IDs: AD-1 zero-infrastructure Hub backend for first-run adoption (spec/02/03/14/19), AD-2 multi-device hardening freeze before new planes (spec/00/14), AD-3 one coordinated wire-format break — `enc.v2` full-carrier AAD + `(epoch,kid)` keyring + founder/`--join` init + signed retention marker (spec/07/15), AD-4 reduce the crypto surface / seek external review (spec/07/15), AD-5 position DevStrap as the substrate agents run on, not a runner — `worktree new --json` primitive + `worktree/agent adopt` + guardrails-not-sandbox (spec/00/02/10), AD-6 "one bad object never wedges" as a tested invariant + chaos multi-device tests (spec/07/16), AD-7 human-readable `workspace.yaml` export/import + `db backup --full`/restore + recovery drill (spec/07/12/16), AD-8 distribution + OSS onboarding workstream — v0.1.0/GoReleaser, Homebrew tap, fork-advisory drift gate, user-facing `docs/` tier, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, Discussions/good-first-issues, bus-factor (spec/02/14).
- Added granular `tracks_code` owners (additive, P6-DOC-04) to spec/05/06/08/09/10/11/15/17/19 where a file documents a package its glob did not cover; left the broad `internal/**`/`cmd/**` catch-alls in place (the P6-QUAL-01 narrowing is a separate code-side change). Bumped `last_reviewed` to 2026-07-01 on every touched spec.

Validated:
- Docs/spec-only cycle — no Go source changed (`gofmt -l cmd internal` clean).
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `go test ./internal/cli` (TestEveryCommandIsDocumented, TestMigrationsDocumented) + `go build ./...`
- `go test -race ./...`

Follow-ups:
- Implement the 40 open pass-6 findings (the 3 pure-doc `P6-DOC-*` items were applied in the audit PR + this revision); start with the AD-2 hardening-freeze cluster (`P6-SEC-01`, `P6-SYNC-01`, `P6-HUB-01`, `P6-DATA-01`, `P6-GIT-01`).
- Land AD-1 (zero-infrastructure Hub backend) and AD-8 (v0.1.0 release + Homebrew tap) to unblock outside adoption.
- Extract the user-facing `docs/` tier and `ARCHITECTURE.md` from the spec corpus; make the fork-PR contribution gate advisory.

## 2026-07-01 — Sixth-pass design & implementation audit (post-PR-#25)

Changed:
- Added `docs/audits/AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-07-01_PASS6.md`: a 43-finding sixth-pass audit (P1=5, P2=25, P3=13) of trunk `8c739b8` (PR #25 — live R2 hub + envelope-encryption foundation). Produced by a verification-driven nine-dimension multi-agent workflow (SEC/SYNC/HUB/GIT/CLI/DATA/QUAL/XP/DOC): every candidate finding was adversarially re-verified against the code (several by building/probing) and novelty-checked against the open backlog; ~22 candidates were refuted or dropped as duplicates. Six exa-backed best-practice research topics anchor the recommendations (local-first sync, e2e crypto, CLI/Cobra, object-store logs, Go supply-chain, git automation) with real source URLs; an Appendix maps P6 findings to the still-open P4/P5 backlog.
- Headline findings: `P6-SEC-01`/`P6-SYNC-01` (P1 — the envelope layer still trusts the hub: unverified `device.key.granted` ingestion, and a single bad event aborts the whole `ApplyEvents` batch and wedges the pull cursor); `P6-HUB-01`/`P6-DATA-01` (P1 — the now-live hub GC deletes live draft blobs; the origin never records its own `draft_snapshots` row); `P6-GIT-01` (P1 — a universal 2-minute git timeout, classified retryable, silently breaks eager materialization of large repos).
- Reconciled the audit ledger (`docs/audits/README.md`) per convention #3: added the pass-6 index row + open backlog (43 rows), moved fully-shipped `P4-SEC-02` into a new *Recently shipped* section, corrected `P4-SEC-05` to *partial* (SHA-pin only), and scoped `P4-SEC-07` to its open remainder. (This applies `P6-DOC-02`.)
- Wove the verified recommendations into 16 spec files, each with a `## Pass 6 audit recommendations (2026-07-01)` section carrying per-finding actionable steps + concrete code/schema/command examples. Applied the pure-doc corrections directly: `P6-DOC-03` (spec/00 stale "planned" sync comment → shipped eager-clone; added `devices recipient`; blockquote chain → single ledger pointer), `P6-DOC-01` (spec/13 status block → R2/S3 Implemented; documented `env rotate`/`hub gc`), and `P6-DOC-04` (added `internal/workspacekeys/**` to spec/07/09/15 `tracks_code`). Added the new audit file to the `tracks_code` of spec/00/12/14/17 and the six research URLs to spec/17. Bumped `last_reviewed` to 2026-07-01 on every touched spec.
- No Go code changed — this is a docs/spec-only cycle; the findings themselves remain open backlog for future implementation PRs.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean — no Go changed)
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli ./internal/state ./internal/specdrift -run 'TestEveryCommandIsDocumented|TestMigrationsDocumented|.' -count=1` (content-staleness + specdrift green; no command/migration reference dropped)
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

Follow-ups:
- Implement the pass-6 backlog, near-term wave first: `P6-SEC-01`, `P6-SYNC-01`, `P6-HUB-01`, `P6-GIT-01`, `P6-DATA-01` (the five P1s), then the P2 cluster. All 43 tracked in `docs/audits/README.md`.
- Work-log rotation (this file is now 1,260+ lines): rotate older cycles into a dated archive (`P6-DOC-02` recommends promoting this to a tracked backlog row).

## 2026-06-30 — Envelope-encrypt the namespace-map event log (P4-SEC-02 + P4-SEC-07 foundation)

Changed:
- **Envelope crypto** (`internal/sync/eventcrypt.go`): `EncryptEvent`/`DecryptEvent` seal the content tuple (Type/PayloadJSON/ContentHash/PrevEventHash) under XChaCha20-Poly1305 (`chacha20poly1305.NewX`, 24-byte random nonce) with AAD = event.ID||uint64(epoch); the carrier (ID/DeviceID/Seq/HLC/DeviceSig) stays plaintext so hub ordering/dedup/signature verification are unchanged. `enc.v1` sentinel + `encryptedEnvelope{Version,Epoch,CT}`. `NewWCK` mints a 32-byte key. Typed errors: `ErrMissingWorkspaceKey`/`ErrUnknownEnvelopeVersion`/`ErrPlaintextEventFromHub`.
- **Migration** (`internal/state/migrations/00013_workspace_keys.sql`): `workspace_keys(workspace_id,epoch,created_at)` + `workspace_key_grants(workspace_id,epoch,recipient,source_event_id,source_event_hlc,source_event_device_id,created_at)` — epoch metadata + grant audit (the wrapped WCK rides the event payload, never SQLite). Schema version 12→13.
- **Store accessors** (`internal/state/store.go`): `CurrentKeyEpoch`/`RecordKeyEpoch`/`HeldKeyEpochs`/`RecordKeyGrant`/`RecordKeyGrantTx`.
- **WCK custody** (`internal/devicekeys/devicekeys.go`): `HybridStore.StoreWCK`/`LoadWCK` (keychain-preferred, 0600 file fallback) keyed `wck.<workspace_id>.<epoch>`; `FileStore.WriteWCK`/`ReadWCK` (base64, 0600).
- **Keyring** (`internal/workspacekeys/keyring.go`): concrete `Keyring` implementing `dssync.WorkspaceKeyring` — `EnsureBootstrap` (mints epoch 1), `GrantAllEpochs` (wraps every held epoch's WCK to a recipient, emits `device.key.granted` events), `Rotate` (mints epoch+1, wraps to remaining `ApprovedRecipients`), `IngestGrant` (age-unwrap, store WCK, record epoch), `Prime`/`WCK`/`CurrentEpoch`. age wrap/unwrap via `filippo.io/age` X25519.
- **Grant event** (`internal/sync/events.go`): `EventDeviceKeyGranted="device.key.granted"` const + `DeviceKeyGrant{Epoch,Recipient,WrappedKey}` struct + `NewDeviceKeyGrantEvent` + `applyEventTx` case (records grant audit; NOT in `mustVerifyEvent` so the bootstrap chicken-and-egg works).
- **Decorator** (`internal/sync/encryptedhub.go`): `EncryptedHub{Hub,Keyring}` — Push encrypts non-grants under the current epoch (grants passthrough), Pull primes/ingests grants in HLC order then decrypts enc.v1, degrading (not aborting) on non-conforming events — missing-epoch truncates, undecryptable/malformed/plaintext-downgrade events are skipped-with-warning (see the "Review fix" note below) — blob ops passthrough. `WorkspaceKeyring` interface defined here so internal/sync has no keychain/platform deps.
- **Wiring** (`internal/cli/hub.go`): `hubFromOptions` wraps both FileHub and R2Hub in `EncryptedHub` via `buildKeyring` (lazy — blob-only paths like `hub gc`/`doctor` never need an epoch). `init.go`: `EnsureBootstrap` at init (no self-grant — avoids epoch collision when a second device joins). `devices.go`: `enroll --approve` and `approve` call `GrantAllEpochs`; `revoke`/`lost` call `Rotate` before blob rewrap; new `devices recipient` read-only helper (prints local age recipient / `--signing` Ed25519 public key for out-of-band enrollment).
- **Tests:** `eventcrypt_test.go` (9), `encryptedhub_test.go` (8, recordingHub+fakeKeyring), `keyring_test.go` (6, incl. `TestNewDeviceReadsHistoryAcrossEpochBump`), devicekeys WCK custody (5), store schema bump. E2E txtar `sync_encrypted.txtar` (ciphertext-only hub `grep enc.v1` + `! grep` plaintext + two-device decrypt + revoke rotate) + `sync_materialize.txtar` updated for enrollment flow.
- **Deps:** `golang.org/x/crypto v0.50.0` promoted indirect→direct.
- **Specs/docs:** spec/07 (envelope format + grant event lifecycle), spec/12 (00013 tables + schema 13 + gitstate bumped to 00014), spec/13 (devices recipient + encryption), spec/15 (metadata-leakage), spec/16 (test plan), spec/18 (this entry); `internal/hub/r2.go`+`internal/sync/hub.go`+`internal/sync/doc.go` doc fixes (event log is envelope-encrypted, not age-encrypted); `docs/audits/README.md` (P4-SEC-02 → shipped, P4-SEC-07 foundation landed).

Validated:
- `go test -race ./...` green (all packages).
- `go build ./...` green.
- E2E: `sync_encrypted.txtar` proves hub stores only `enc.v1` carriers (no plaintext path/remote), B decrypts after enroll+approve, revoke rotates to epoch 2.
- `TestMigrationsDocumented` green (00013 in spec/12).

Follow-ups:
- P4-SEC-07 full: workspace-ID pairing across devices (spec/07 §211 anticipates provisioning the same logical `ws_...` id; currently each `init` mints a separate workspace id, and the joining device's bootstrap WCK is overwritten by the origin device's grant on first pull — functional but not the intended shared-workspace model).
- P4-SEC-08 (hub-side grant verification / anti-replay) remains open.
- Hub-based WCK recovery for a solo device that loses its keychain (self-grant removed to avoid epoch collision; a re-grant from another device is the recovery path in a multi-device workspace).
- `golangci-lint run` + `gofmt -w cmd internal` to be run before PR.

Review fix (subagent review of PR #25) — make `EncryptedHub.Pull` non-wedging:
- The original `Pull` returned an error on the *first* enc.v1 event it could not decrypt or whose epoch it did not hold, and the caller (`internal/cli/sync.go`) does `return err`, so the whole batch aborted and the pull cursor never advanced. Since `Pull(afterHLC)` only returns events with HLC past the cursor, a single un-decryptable object (wrong-key cross-device epoch collision, corruption, forgery, or an unexpected plaintext/downgrade event) permanently wedged that device's sync and never reached `ApplyEvents`' quarantine + safe-cursor machinery. This is the exact self-DoS the zero-knowledge/untrusted-hub model must resist.
- `Pull` now degrades instead of aborting: a **missing epoch key** (grant not yet propagated) **truncates** the batch — the decryptable prefix is returned so it applies and the cursor advances up to but not past that event, and the next sync retries once the grant arrives; a **held-epoch decrypt failure**, a **malformed/unknown envelope**, and a **non-grant plaintext event** (anti-downgrade) are each **skipped with a loud `logging.Logger(ctx).Warn`** and Pull continues. Bad events are still never applied (the security property holds — no unauthenticated data enters the log), but one bad object can no longer brick a device. This also de-fangs the acknowledged P4-SEC-07 epoch-collision case (it now logs + skips on the affected device rather than wedging) and removes the anti-downgrade brick for a stale/pre-envelope hub.
- Tests: rewrote `TestEncryptedHubAntiDowngrade`/`TestEncryptedHubMissingEpoch`/`TestEncryptedHubUnknownVersion` to assert the skip/truncate contract, and added `TestEncryptedHubPoisonEventDoesNotWedge` (good events on either side of a wrong-key epoch-1 poison event still deliver). The typed sentinels remain in use (`ErrMissingWorkspaceKey` still guards `Push`; `ErrUnknownEnvelopeVersion`/`ErrPlaintextEventFromHub` from `ParseEncryptedEnvelope`).
- Validated: `gofmt -w cmd internal`; `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` — 0 issues; `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` — passed; `go test -race ./...` — green (incl. `cmd/devstrap` e2e and `internal/cli`).

## 2026-06-30 — Wire the live R2/S3 hub (P5-HUB-01)

Changed:
- **Production S3 adapter** (`internal/hub/s3client_awssdk.go`): `S3Adapter` implements the shipped `S3Client` interface over `aws-sdk-go-v2` (`s3.New(s3.Options{...})` with `BaseEndpoint`+`UsePathStyle:true` for R2/MinIO, `aws.NopRetryer{}` so `R2Hub.Retry` is the single retry layer, and an inline `aws.CredentialsProviderFunc` — no `config.LoadDefaultConfig`/SSO/IMDS/STS chain). PutObject (`IfNoneMatch:"*"`), GetObject (deferred Close), ObjectExists (HEAD→404=false), idempotent DeleteObject, ListObjectsV2 (clamped [1,1000], last key as nextStartAfter). `mapS3Error` classifies 412/PreconditionFailed→`ErrPreconditionFailed`, NoSuchKey/NotFound/404→`ErrBlobNotFound`, 429/503/SlowDown/TooManyRequests→`ErrS3Throttle`, 500/502/504/InternalError→`ErrS3Transient`, no-APIError→`ErrS3Transient`, other API→raw terminal.
- **Tests:** `internal/hub/s3client_awssdk_test.go` (hermetic `mapS3Error` + NewS3Client validation); `internal/hub/r2_test.go` refactored to a shared `assertHubRoundTrip` conformance contract (`TestR2ConformanceMemS3`); `internal/hub/r2_minio_test.go` env-gated `TestR2MinIOConformance` (skips unless `DEVSTRAP_HUB_S3_ENDPOINT`).
- **Wiring** (`internal/cli/hub.go`): `hubFromOptions(ctx, opts, store, hubFile)` r2:// branch — workspace id via `store.WorkspaceID`, creds from viper `hub_s3_*` + `AWS_` fallbacks, builds `S3Adapter`, returns `R2Hub{}` with hub-id `"r2:"+ws`. Pure `parseHubURI` (rejects credentials-in-URI) + store-free `hubConfigured`. Call sites updated: `sync.go`, `doctor.go`, `devices.go`, `hub gc`, `run_loop.go` preflight (→`hubConfigured`). `internal/cli/hub_test.go` for `parseHubURI`/`hubConfigured`.
- **Deps:** `go.mod`/`go.sum` — aws-sdk-go-v2 v1.42.0, service/s3 v1.104.1, smithy-go v1.27.3 (+ indirects).
- **Specs/docs:** flipped R2/S3 hub from planned→shipped across spec/00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 09, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 + `docs/audits/README.md` (P5-HUB-01 → shipped, 5 open → 4 open); `last_reviewed` bumped to 2026-06-30 on edited specs.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w`, `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...` clean; `go mod tidy` idempotent.
- `golangci-lint run` (v2.12.0, bodyclose+gosec) — 0 issues (fixed errcheck on `Body.Close` via named-return defer; 7× errorlint `%v`→`%w`).
- `go test -race -covermode=atomic ./...` — all green; total coverage 54.8% (≥50% floor), `internal/hub` 67.1% (`mapS3Error` 100%, `parseHubURI` 93.8%, `hubConfigured` 100%).
- `govulncheck` — 0 vulnerabilities affecting called code.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` — green after spec updates.

Follow-ups:
- `P5-SYNC-01` (open, latent) — transport-cursor redesign; design in `spec/07`.
- Optional manual live MinIO round-trip (`docker run minio/minio` + `DEVSTRAP_HUB_S3_* go test -run TestR2MinIOConformance ./internal/hub`); requires Docker, not run in CI.
- Open PR `fix/p5-hub-01` → `main`, run adversarial review, merge after green CI.

## 2026-06-30 — Implement the fifth-pass (PASS5) open backlog

Changed (grouped by batch; IDs reference `docs/audits/AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-29_PASS5.md` and PASS4 Appendix A):

- **Security (P1 + P2/P3):** `P5-SEC-01` (P1) — revoke rewrap emits a superseding `draft.snapshot.created` event and pushes event+blob to the hub before deleting the old ciphertext (`rewrapHubCleanup` ordering), so peers never replay a deleted ref. `P5-SEC-04` — env (local-only) vs draft (hub-synced) blob refs partitioned (`EnvBlobRefs`/`DraftBlobRefs`); env blobs never uploaded/deleted on the hub. `P5-SEC-02` — `draftbundle.ExtractWithLimits` charges the decompression budget on every tar entry and rejects unknown types. `P5-SEC-03` — `rebuildDependencies` runs through `childenv`. `P5-SEC-05` — `redact.Writer` caps its line buffer at 1 MiB (`emitLine` helper).
- **Sync convergence:** `P5-SYNC-02` — `ResolveConflictByFingerprint` drops the device-local `namespace_id` from its match. `P5-SYNC-03` — `RenameProject` leaves a tombstone at the old path. `P5-SYNC-04` — `conflicts resolve --keep-*` is authoritative (emits dominating `project.*` events via `internal/cli/conflict_resolve.go`; keep-remote delete-then-adds the alternate; keep-both adds a sibling). `P5-QUAL-01` — `materialize` classifies "no draft bundle yet" as skipped, not failed.
- **Hub:** `P5-HUB-01` — `hubFromOptions` selection seam routes sync/run-loop/hub-gc; r2:// returns a not-yet-wired error. `P5-HUB-02` — `devstrap hub gc` + `Hub.ListBlobs` + `PruneDraftSnapshots`. `P5-HUB-03` — `R2Hub.RetentionHLC` floor + `ErrSnapshotRequired`. `P5-HUB-04` — bounded-concurrency `R2Hub.Pull`.
- **Product:** `P5-PROD-01` reachable "ready" status; `P5-PROD-02` `pending_hub_deletes` queue (migration 00011) drained on sync; `P5-PROD-03` `devstrap env rotate`; `P5-PROD-04` README documents `clone`; `P5-PROD-05` `doctor --remote` + `status --watch`.
- **CLI/DX:** `P5-CLI-02` thread `--partial`; `P5-CLI-03` `MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive` on clone; `P5-CLI-04` `ssh -G` host-alias resolution; `P5-CLI-05` run-loop/devices stderr + consecutive-failure exit; `P5-DX-01` dynamic shell completion (paths + enum flags); `P5-CLI-01` `options.render` seam wired into `materialize` (broader rollout deferred).
- **Data/docs/CI:** `P5-DATA-01` spec/12 migration inventory; `P5-DATA-02` migration 00012 (partial UNIQUE index + `INSERT OR IGNORE`); `P5-DOC-01` spec/07 draft/hub truth; `P5-DOC-02` spec/00 de-contradicted + command inventory; `P5-DX-02` `TestMigrationsDocumented` + AGENTS.md note; `P5-QUAL-02` run-loop/draft testscripts + jitter unit test; `P5-QUAL-03` clamped jitter bound; `P5-QUAL-04` CI coverage floor (50%); `P4-QUAL-07` `bodyclose`+`sqlclosecheck` linters; `P4-SEC-05` SHA-pin `goreleaser-action`.
- Schema version 10 -> 12 (migrations 00011, 00012).

Validated:
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean), `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go mod tidy` (no diff).
- `golangci-lint run` (v2.12.0) — 0 issues (with the new `bodyclose`/`sqlclosecheck` enabled).
- `GOCACHE=… DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...` — all packages green.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` after this work-log + spec updates.
- Adversarial multi-agent review of the diff (5 dimension reviewers + per-finding verification) surfaced 7 confirmed defects (3 P2, 4 P3), all fixed before handoff: dependency-rebuild now uses `AgentAllowlist`+`HOME=projectdir` (was leaking ssh-agent/real HOME to lifecycle scripts); `conflicts resolve` enacts BEFORE emitting the `conflict.resolved` event (a failed/inapplicable resolution no longer diverges peers) and `--keep-remote` is a single atomic `project.updated` (no delete-then-add tombstone-without-re-add window); `LatestDraftSnapshot` ordering aligned with `PruneDraftSnapshots` (HLC-first) so prune can't delete the materialized snapshot; `hub gc --dry-run` uses `RetainedBlobRefs` for an accurate preview; SSH alias resolution rejects leading-dash aliases (option-injection guard) and the file parser honors OpenSSH negation; `env rotate`/`env capture` share the `git_repo` guard.

Follow-ups (deliberately deferred, documented with design):
- `P5-SYNC-01` (open, P2, latent) — decouple the transport cursor from logical HLC via a hub-assigned ingestion position; a core-engine change best landed as its own PR with multi-device tests, paired with `SYNC-02`/`HUB-11` snapshot/compaction (design recorded in `spec/07`).
- `P5-HUB-01` remaining step — the production `aws-sdk-go-v2` S3 client adapter + MinIO/LocalStack integration test (the seam, keying, retry, conditional-put, and GC logic are shipped and unit-tested).
- `P5-CLI-01` — extend the `render` seam to all leaf commands (or reject `--json` where unsupported).
- `P5-ARCH-01` — convergence is covered by new property-style apply tests; the formal pure `Decide(state,event)` extraction remains.
- PASS4 carried XL items: `SEC-07` envelope encryption (the structural fix for the revoke/rewrap model), `GIT-03` OS-enforced agent sandbox, `SEC-02`/`SEC-04` at-rest map encryption + fail-closed enrollment, `SYNC-02`/`HUB-11` compaction.

## 2026-06-29 — Consolidate audit files into docs/audits/ + status ledger (P5-PROC-01)

Changed:
- Moved all five `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS*.md` from the repo root into `docs/audits/` (`git mv`) to declutter the root and end cross-pass finding-ID collisions (fifth-pass finding `P5-PROC-01`).
- Added `docs/audits/README.md` — the single source-of-truth audit ledger: a pass index, go-forward conventions (pass-scoped unique IDs, archive policy, work-log-rotation note), and a consolidated **open backlog** (Pass 5's 36 findings plus Pass 4's ~25 still-open items, pass-scoped as `P4-*`/`P5-*`; earlier passes superseded).
- Rewrote every reference to the moved files: `tracks_code:` frontmatter in `spec/00`, `spec/12`, `spec/14`, `spec/17`; prose pointers across `spec/00`–`spec/19` and `spec/adr/*`; the two README audit links (now pointing at the archive index with PASS5 as latest); the `internal/sync/doc.go` comment; and the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` glob example. Historical `spec/18_WORK_LOG.md` entries were left referencing the old root paths (accurate for when they happened).
- Generalized the spec-drift gate: `internal/specdrift/specdrift.go` `requiresWorkLog` now treats any change under `docs/` as work-log-requiring (replacing the exact `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` special-case), so the moved audit docs and future docs still gate on the work log.

Validated:
- `gofmt -l`, `go build ./...`, `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./... -count=1` (incl. `internal/specdrift`), and `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (green). A repo-wide sweep confirms no bare root `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS` references remain outside the archive and the historical work-log entries.

Follow-ups:
- Work-log rotation (archive cycles older than the two most recent passes into a dated file) remains a deferred follow-up to keep this PR reviewable.

## 2026-06-29 — Fifth-pass design & implementation audit (post-PR-#20)

Changed:
- Added `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-29_PASS5.md` at the repo root — a fifth-pass audit of trunk `be664ba`, focused on (a) adversarial review of the just-landed PASS4 batch code (forge/conflicts/clone/materialize/run-loop/blob_gc/hub-r2/draftbundle), (b) dimensions PASS4 under-examined (convergence of the new conflict/rename paths, end-to-end hub reachability, CLI scriptability, observability, spec truth, process hygiene), and (c) concrete new features.
- Produced by a verification-driven 7-dimension multi-agent workflow (per-dimension review → independent adversarial verification of every finding against the live code → consolidation): 43 candidate findings, 41 verified, **36 reported (P1=1, P2=12, P3=23)** after merging overlaps. Uses a `P5-` ID prefix to end the cross-pass ID collisions the audit itself flags (`P5-PROC-01`).
- Headline findings: `P5-SEC-01` (P1) revoke rewrap deletes the old hub blob without emitting a superseding namespace event → other devices permanently lose draft access; `P5-HUB-01` the R2 backend is unwired (no aws-sdk dependency, dead `R2Config`, `FileHub` hardcoded, no selection seam); `P5-SYNC-01..04` convergence/conflict regressions in the just-landed code (HLC-keyed pull cursor strands cross-batch events; `conflict.resolved` bakes a device-local namespace_id so it can't converge; rename leaves no source tombstone; `conflicts resolve --keep-*` never mutates state); `P5-QUAL-01` the `materialize` exit-code fix backfires on synced local-only projects; `P5-DX-02` the spec-drift gate is blind to prose staleness.

Validated:
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` (green).
- Docs-only change; no Go code modified (gofmt/build/`go test` n/a). Every finding cites `file:line` against `be664ba` and was independently adversarially verified against the live tree before inclusion.

Follow-ups:
- Implementing the 36 findings is future work; highest priority: `P5-SEC-01` + envelope encryption (`SEC-07`), `P5-HUB-01` reachability (S3 adapter + `hubFromOptions` + MinIO integration test), `P5-SYNC-02`/`P5-SYNC-04` conflict convergence, `P5-QUAL-01` exit-code fix, and `P5-DX-02` gate hardening.
- The stale-spec findings (`P5-DOC-01`/`P5-DOC-02`/`P5-DATA-01`) are documentation follow-ups; this cycle adds the audit, not the spec fixes.

## 2026-06-29 — PASS4 audit Phase A/D quick wins (part 4)

Changed:
- Continued PASS4 quick wins: GIT-05 (P2), PROD-06 (P2), GIT-06 (P2).
- **GIT-05**: forge detection now supports self-hosted GitLab/Gitea/Forgejo. New `ResolveForge` with documented precedence — `--forge` flag > per-project `git_repos.forge_kind` column > `[forge] host = kind` config map > `DetectForge` heuristic. Added migration `00010_repo_forge_kind.sql` (new `forge_kind` column, schema version 10), `Store.SetProjectForgeKind`, and threaded `ForgeKind` through `UpsertProjectParams`/`ProjectStatus`/`GitRepo` + the UPSERTs and SELECTs. SSH host aliases (`~/.ssh/config` `Host`->`HostName`) are resolved before detection so `git@work-gitlab:org/repo` maps to the real host. `agent pr` gained a `--forge` flag; `doctor` now iterates adopted git-repo remotes, resolves the forge, and warns when the matching CLI (`gh`/`glab`/`tea`) is missing or the forge is unknown.
- **PROD-06**: `conflicts` is now a command group (`list`/`show`/`resolve`) instead of a list-only leaf. `resolve <id>` accepts exactly one of `--keep-local`/`--keep-remote`/`--keep-both`, marks the row `resolved` (so the `status` open-conflict count converges), records the decision in `resolution_json`, and emits a signed `conflict.resolved` HLC event (`CreateConflictResolvedEvent`) so every device sees the same outcome. `devstrap conflicts` with no subcommand still lists.
- **GIT-06**: the materialize/hydrate clone path now initializes submodules (`--recurse-submodules` + `--also-filter-submodules` for blobless submodules) under a `materialization.submodules` policy (`auto` default / `never`). Added `git.CloneOptions` + `CloneWithOptions` (keeping `Clone` as a thin wrapper) and a `Runner.MaintenanceRun` helper; an opt-in `materialization.maintenance` config runs a one-time `git maintenance run --auto` after clone so blobless clones do not trigger per-object lazy-fetch storms. `doctor` surfaces the blobless-clone offline caveat (historical blobs need the promisor online).
- Tests: `TestParseForgeKind`/`TestResolveForgePrecedence`/`TestSSHHostMatch`/`TestResolveSSHHostAlias`/`TestDetectForgeResolvesSSHAlias` + a `--forge gitlab` fake-CLI override test (GIT-05); `TestResolveActionValidation`/`TestConflictsListShowResolve` (PROD-06); `TestCloneArgsSubmodules`/`TestCloneWithOptionsInitializesSubmodules` (real-git submodule clone) (GIT-06); updated `TestInitStatusAndDBCommands`/`TestMigrateEnsureSummaryAndVersion`/`TestMigrationDownAndUp` for schema version 10.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `go vet`, `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./... -count=1` (all green), `spec-drift` passes (20 specs, 52 changed files).
- golangci-lint not installed in this environment.

Follow-ups:
- GIT-05: per-project forge override has no `set` CLI yet (the column is writable via `SetProjectForgeKind`); native Bitbucket/Azure PR clients; broader FORGE-05 hermetic fake-CLI tests.
- PROD-06: `--keep-both` records the dual-copy intent and clears the row; it does not auto-clone the remote variant under a sibling path (no network/ambiguity risk). Honoring a prior resolution to suppress re-conflict on re-sync is a sync-engine follow-up.
- GIT-06: per-project `materialization.submodules` column (currently config-level only); `git maintenance start` (scheduled) vs the one-time `run --auto`; submodule hydrate-state recording.
- Remaining: SEC-02 (encrypt namespace map, L), SEC-04 (bootstrap pinning, deferred), SEC-05 (release signing), SYNC-02/HUB-11 (compaction, L), SYNC-06 (tombstone GC), SYNC-03 (needs HLC test refactor), SYNC-05 (folded hash + signed head), QUAL-02 (property tests), SEC-07/08, HUB-14/15/16, GIT-04 (worktree GC), GIT-03 (XL sandbox), PROD-04/05, and Phase E.

## 2026-06-29 — PASS4 audit Phase A/D quick wins (part 3)

Changed:
- Continued PASS4 quick wins: PROD-01 (P1), PROD-02 (P1), SYNC-04 (P2), QUAL-01 (P1).
- **PROD-01**: added `devstrap clone <url> [path]` — a one-shot quick path that derives a namespace path from the remote (`work/<org>/<repo>`, overridable), runs the existing add + eager materialize (blobless clone + env hydrate) + optional `--open`/`--vscode`. Extracted a shared `addProject` helper from `add` so clone is a thin orchestrator over existing internals. Registered in `root.go`; documented in `spec/13` (command-doc drift gate satisfied).
- **PROD-02**: `doctor` is now a severity-graded health report. Each check returns `{name, status: ok|warning|error, detail, remedy}`; rendered as a graded table + summary line, with a non-zero exit on any error (CI-gateable). `--json` emits the check array; `--fix` applies safe remediations (create missing state home, run pending migrations, clear stale repo locks via `clearRepoLock`) and re-runs checks; `--no-network` flag added. Checks cover git (required)/gh/go (optional), state home, schema version, SQLite quick_check/foreign_key_check, secrets needing rotation, device age + Ed25519 key health, and held repo locks (stale = warning).
- **SYNC-04**: the push side is now cursor-bounded. `runSyncCycle` reads a per-hub `push:<hubID>` watermark, fetches only local-origin events with `HLC > pushCursor` via the new `Store.LocalPendingEvents(ctx, afterHLC)`, pushes them, and advances the watermark. Remote-origin events are no longer re-uploaded every cycle (the hub already holds them from their origin device), so a no-op sync pushes zero instead of the whole log.
- **QUAL-01**: `draftbundle.Extract` now enforces an aggregate decompression budget (max total uncompressed bytes + max file count) via the new `ExtractWithLimits`, aborting a gzip/tar decompression bomb authored by a compromised-but-trusted device with `ErrBundleTooLarge` (the per-file `LimitReader` alone did not bound total size/count). `Extract` delegates with the Pack-side defaults (100 MiB / 5000 files). Added Go native fuzz targets `FuzzParseBytes` (envfile) and `FuzzCompile` (ignore) with seed corpora from existing table tests; they run as ordinary tests on `go test` and fuzz under `-fuzz`.
- Tests: `TestDeriveClonePath` + `clone.txtar` (PROD-01), `doctor.txtar` + updated `TestInitStatusAndDBCommands`/`init_status.txtar` for the graded format (PROD-02), `sync_push_cursor.txtar` (SYNC-04), `TestExtractRejectsTooManyFiles`/`TestExtractRejectsOversizedBundle` (QUAL-01), `FuzzParseBytes`/`FuzzCompile` seed corpus (QUAL-01).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `go vet`, `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./... -count=1` (all green), `go test -race` on touched packages, `spec-drift` passes.
- golangci-lint not installed in this environment.

Follow-ups:
- QUAL-01 CI fuzz step (`go test -fuzz=... -fuzztime=30s`) and `FuzzCanonicalRemoteKey`/`FuzzExtract` not yet wired (the fuzz targets exist and pass seed corpora; the CI step + the git/draftbundle fuzz targets remain).
- Remaining: SEC-02 (encrypt namespace map, L), SEC-04 (bootstrap pinning, deferred), SEC-05 (release signing), SYNC-02/HUB-11 (compaction, L), SYNC-06 (tombstone GC), SYNC-03 (needs HLC test refactor), QUAL-02 (property tests), GIT-04/05/06, HUB-14/15/16, PROD-04/05/06, and Phase E.

## 2026-06-29 — PASS4 audit Phase A quick wins (part 2)

Changed:
- Continued the PASS4 audit quick wins: SYNC-01 (P1, low-water-mark cursor), QUAL-06 (P2, jitter + aggregate retry budget), PROD-03 (P2, guided init).
- **SYNC-01**: `ApplyEvents` now returns a low-water-mark safe cursor instead of `maxAppliedHLC`. It tracks `lowestUnappliedHLC` over every transiently-skipped event (skew-ahead quarantine and hash-chain breaks) and returns `min(maxAppliedHLC, lowestUnappliedHLC-1)`, so a skipped event with a lower HLC than a higher-HLC applied event is never permanently stranded — the hub pull cursor never advances past it, so it is re-delivered next cycle. Permanently-invalid events (HLC<=0 / below epoch floor) are recorded as conflicts but do NOT hold the cursor (they will never re-apply, and holding at a non-positive cursor would strand every higher event). `runSyncCycle` advances the cursor to the returned safe value. The misleading "will be re-delivered next pull" comment was corrected.
- **QUAL-06**: git network retry backoff switched from deterministic linear (`base*attempt`) to full-jitter capped exponential (`jitterDelay`: uniform in `[1, min(cap, base*2^(attempt-1))]`), the AWS-recommended scheme, so parallel materialize workers no longer retry in lockstep (thundering herd) against a struggling forge. `Runner` gained `RetryCap` (default 5s) and `MaxElapsed` (optional aggregate wall-clock budget per operation; when set, the retry loop stops once elapsed). `sleepBackoff` takes the cap; `jitterDelay` is a pure function taking a `randFn` for deterministic seeded-RNG testing.
- **PROD-03**: `devstrap init` gained a `--scan` flag that runs the existing scan/adopt path inline after workspace creation, so a user with a populated `~/Code` sees their tree adopted on the very first command (the "epiphany" moment). The adopt logic was extracted into a shared `adoptFindings` helper used by both `scan --adopt` and `init --scan`. `init` always prints a short next-steps hint (`devstrap status • devstrap scan --adopt • devstrap sync --hub-file <path>`) per clig.dev guidance.
- **HUB-13**: `FileHub.Pull` and `R2Hub.Pull` now filter with an inclusive `>= afterHLC` boundary instead of strict `>`, so a same-HLC event from another device that arrives after the cursor was advanced to that HLC is still delivered on the next pull (HLC is not globally unique across devices). Re-delivering the boundary is safe because `ApplyEvents`/`InsertEvent` dedups by event ID. The Hub doc comment was updated to document the inclusive boundary. The composite-`(HLC,device,id)` cursor (zero re-delivery) is deferred as a future optimization; the inclusive overlap is the audit's recommended cheap fix.
- Tests: `TestApplyEventsLowWaterMarkCursorHoldsBelowSkippedEvent` / `TestApplyEventsPermanentInvalidDoesNotHoldCursor` (SYNC-01), `TestJitterDelayFullJitterBounded` (QUAL-06), `init_scan.txtar` (PROD-03), `TestFileHubPullInclusiveBoundaryDeliversSameHLC` (HUB-13); updated `TestR2PullCursorIncremental` and `sync_materialize.txtar` for the inclusive boundary.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `go vet ./internal/git/ ./internal/cli/ ./internal/sync/`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./... -count=1` (all green)
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- Subagent code review (PR #20) found one MAJOR: `rewrapBlobsOnRevoke` deleted old hub ciphertext even when the rewrapped-blob push failed (hub data loss). Fixed by gating the delete on a successful push (extracted `rewrapHubCleanup` with early-return gating) + added `TestRewrapHubCleanupKeepsOldBlobOnPushFailure`/`TestRewrapHubCleanupDeletesOldBlobOnSuccess`; also clamped `R2Retry.sleep` exp to `[1,cap]` for overflow robustness. Re-validated full suite + spec-drift green.

Follow-ups:
- Remaining Phase A: SEC-04 (fail-closed bootstrap — the fail-closed-once-enrolled logic is already implemented; the pre-enrollment bootstrap-window closure requires an out-of-band pinning ceremony + authenticated snapshot and changes the core sync-without-enroll demo flow, so it is deferred as L-effort), SEC-02 (encrypt namespace map, L), SEC-05 (sign releases, infra). Then Phases B–E.
- SYNC-03 (P2/S) deferred: raising `epochFloorMS` + adding the past-direction staleness bound requires updating all deterministic sync tests to use realistic HLC physical components (they currently use `physical=0`), a coordinated refactor.
- QUAL-06 materialize-pass aggregate context deadline not yet wired (the per-operation `MaxElapsed` field is in place for callers to opt into); deferred to avoid breaking slow CI clones.

## 2026-06-29 — PASS4 audit Phase A quick wins (part 1)

Changed:
- Implemented the first batch of `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-28_PASS4.md` Phase A "make the hub backend safe to turn on" quick wins.
- **GIT-02**: `git.Clone` now uses a clone-specific retry that `os.RemoveAll`+`os.MkdirAll` the destination before every retry, so a transient mid-clone network failure (which leaves the pre-existing `MkdirTemp` dest partially populated) is recoverable instead of fatal "destination path already exists and is not empty". Extracted a shared `sleepBackoff` helper used by both `Clone` and `runWithNetworkRetry`.
- **QUAL-03**: `devstrap materialize` now returns non-zero (`ErrPartialMaterialize`) when any project fails, while still completing the batch (EAGER-04 isolation), so CI/cron gates and `&&` chains can detect partial failure.
- **HUB-09**: `R2Hub.Push`/`PutBlob` dropped the redundant `ObjectExists` (HEAD) pre-check; the conditional put (`If-None-Match: *`) is the atomic guard. Added a typed `ErrPreconditionFailed` (R2 412/10031) returned by the `memS3` double and classified as an idempotent dedup hit, halving Class B request volume and closing the TOCTOU race.
- **SEC-03**: `pullReferencedBlobs` now recomputes sha256 of fetched ciphertext and rejects on mismatch against the signed `age_blob:<sha256>` ref (`verifyBlobContentHash`), so a malicious/buggy hub cannot substitute bytes under a valid content-addressed key. Mismatched blobs are not cached and surface as missing/tampered.
- **GIT-01**: `hydrateProjectUnlocked` verifies a resolvable HEAD after promote; if HEAD is unresolvable it self-heals (re-resolve remote default branch + checkout) and records an honest `materialized-empty` state (surfaced in `status` as "empty checkout") when commits exist but HEAD is broken. A legitimately empty repo (no commits) is still recorded as `available` so hydrating a fresh remote succeeds.
- **HUB-10**: `R2Hub` now wraps every S3 call (`Push`/`Pull`/`PutBlob`/`GetBlob`) in an `R2Retry` seam with throttle/transient/terminal error classification and capped exponential backoff + full jitter; the context is honored between attempts. `ErrS3Throttle`/`ErrS3Transient` sentinels; terminal errors (incl. 412, not-found, auth) fail fast. A zero-value `R2Retry` uses a default policy; tests inject a deterministic jitter + tiny delays. The real aws-sdk-go-v2 standard retryer will slot behind this seam when the SDK is wired.
- **SEC-06**: `redact.tokenPatterns` extended with GitLab (`glpat-`), Stripe (`sk_live_`/`rk_live_`), generic `Bearer <token>`, and a JSON-secret-field redactor (`jsonSecretField`) that masks the value of any field named like a secret (secret/token/password/private_key/api_key/authorization) while preserving the key — catching GCP service-account `private_key` (base64 on one JSON line) and Snowflake config passwords the bare token-prefix patterns miss.
- **SEC-01**: added `DeleteBlob` to the `Hub` interface (+ `FileHub`, `R2Hub`) and `DeleteObject` to `S3Client` (+ `memS3`), the reclamation primitive that makes blob/event GC possible (also serves HUB-12). `rewrapBlobsOnRevoke` is now hub-aware: when a hub is provided it pulls non-cached blobs from the hub (with SEC-03 hash verification) before rewrapping, `PutBlob`s the rewrapped blob, and `DeleteBlob`s the old ciphertext (guarded by `blobRefStillReferenced` so a still-referenced blob is never deleted). `devstrap devices revoke|lost` gained an optional `--hub-file` to trigger hub-side cleanup at revoke time; without it, rewrap is local-only and hub cleanup is deferred to the next sync. `needs_rotation` remains belt-and-suspenders since already-downloaded ciphertext is irrecoverably exposed.
- Tests: `TestCloneRetryCleansPartialDestination` (GIT-02), `TestR2WritePathSkipsObjectExists` (HUB-09), `TestR2PushRetriesThrottling`/`TestR2PushRetriesTransient`/`TestR2PushDoesNotRetryTerminal`/`TestR2RetryRespectsContextCancellation` (HUB-10), `TestVerifyBlobContentHash` (SEC-03), `TestScrubExtendedTokenShapes`/`TestScrubJSONSecretFields` (SEC-06), `TestR2HubDeleteBlob`/`TestFileHubBlobPutGetDelete`/`TestFileHubDeleteBlobLeavesEventLogUntouched` (SEC-01/HUB-12), `materialize_nonzero_on_failure.txtar` (QUAL-03).
- Note: the PASS4 audit reuses `GIT-01`/`GIT-02` IDs (empty-checkout / clone-retry) that collide with the second-pass audit's same-named findings; spec prose will reference the PASS4 audit file to disambiguate. Specs are reconciled in the end-of-session review (AGENTS.md).

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`, `go vet ./internal/hub/... ./internal/git/... ./internal/cli/... ./internal/redact/...`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./...` (all green)
- New tests green: GIT-02, HUB-09, HUB-10, SEC-03, SEC-06, QUAL-03 testscript.

Follow-ups:
- Remaining Phase A: SEC-04 (fail-closed bootstrap), SEC-02 (encrypt namespace map, L), SEC-05 (sign releases). Then Phases B–E.
- SEC-01 signed `env.bundle.reencrypted` audit event (audit step 4) not yet emitted; the core revoke-delete + rewrap is done, the audit-trail event is deferred.
- SEC-03 sender-authentication (Ed25519 producer signature over bundles) is a larger sub-item; hash-verification (the headline "verify blob hashes on fetch") is done, producer-signature deferred.

## 2026-06-28 — README rebuild with brand banner + app icon

Changed:
- Rewrote `README.md` to modern open-source conventions: a centered `repo_image2.png` brand banner in the header, a badge row (CI, Go Report Card, Go 1.26, platform, MIT, alpha status), a table of contents, and clear sections (What is it / Why / How it works / Features / Status / Requirements / Install / Quickstart / Command reference / Architecture / Roadmap / Security / Contributing / License).
- Added the brand assets `repo_image2.png` (header banner) and `icon.png` (app icon for the forthcoming desktop/menu-bar app, referenced in the footer) at the repo root.
- Corrected stale content: the old README still described a `dev` integration branch; the Contributing section now states the canonical **trunk-based** model (single protected `main`, no `dev`) per `AGENTS.md`. Updated the status/feature/command sections to reflect the now-shipped cloud-sync workstreams (eager `materialize`, `draft`, the pluggable `Hub` + R2/S3 backend, portable `run-loop`) and the full 19-command surface; linked the latest audit (`AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-28_PASS4.md`).

Validated:
- Command table cross-checked against `internal/cli/root.go` `AddCommand` registrations and each command's cobra `Short` string; Go version against `go.mod` (1.26); install story against the GoReleaser pipeline (binaries; no Homebrew tap yet — flagged as roadmap `PROD-05`).
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- None. A Homebrew tap / `curl | sh` installer (audit `PROD-05`) and the brand assets' use in the future app remain future work.

## 2026-06-28 — Fourth-pass design & implementation audit (post-PR-#16)

Changed:
- Added `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-28_PASS4.md` at the repo root — a fourth-pass audit of the *now-shipped* cloud-sync system (PR #16). Produced by a six-dimension multi-agent review (per-dimension audit → independent adversarial grounding against the live tree → sectioned synthesis) with external best-practice research, yielding **44 verified findings** (P1=17, P2=23, P3=4) across Security/Crypto (`SEC-*`), Sync Engine & Data Model (`SYNC-*`), Cloud Hub & Scalability (`HUB-09..16`), Git Materialization & Agents (`GIT-*`), Code Quality & Testing (`QUAL-*`), and Product/UX & New Features (`PROD-*`). The new cloud-hub findings are numbered `HUB-09..16` to continue (not collide with) the shipped `HUB-01..08`.
- Linked the new audit from `spec/00_START_HERE.md` (a third top-of-file blockquote, matching the prior two audits) and added it to that file's `tracks_code` frontmatter.
- Headline findings: encrypt the namespace map before R2 upload (`SEC-02`), verify content-addressed blobs on fetch (`SEC-03`), make device revocation actually delete/rotate hub ciphertext (`SEC-01`), wire event-log compaction/snapshot + hub-side GC (`SYNC-02`/`HUB-11`/`HUB-12`), fix the clone network-retry-into-non-empty-dir bug (`GIT-02`) and record honest state on empty checkouts (`GIT-01`), and grow the product surface (`devstrap clone`, graded `doctor --fix`, `service install` daemon — `PROD-01/02/04`).

Validated:
- Each finding carries `file:line`/spec evidence checked by an adversarial verifier (already-implemented / unsupported findings were dropped or rescoped); e.g. the initial `GIT-01` "needs `ls-remote --symref`" claim was corrected to "verify non-empty checkout" after confirming `git clone` already resolves HEAD over the protocol handshake.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- This audit is the recommendation backlog; converting `SEC-*`/`SYNC-*`/`HUB-09..16`/`GIT-*`/`QUAL-*`/`PROD-*` into implemented workstreams is the next set of cycles. Sequencing guidance is in the audit's Appendix C.

## 2026-06-28 — go.mod hygiene hotfix (main CI red after PR #16)

Changed:
- `go mod tidy` promoted `golang.org/x/sync v0.21.0` from the `// indirect` block to the direct `require` block. It is a direct dependency — `internal/cli/materialize.go` imports `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup` for the bounded-concurrency eager materialization added in PR #16 — but the dependency was added without re-tidying, so go.mod was left inconsistent.
- This was latent in PR #16: the CI `Go tests` job runs `Test` before `Module hygiene`, so while the e2e testscripts failed (`Test`), the job never reached the `go mod tidy` / `git diff --exit-code` check. The testscript fix unblocked `Test`, which exposed the go.mod drift and left `main` red post-merge.

Validated:
- `go mod tidy` is now idempotent (second run is a no-op); `go.sum` unchanged.
- `gofmt -l cmd internal` (clean), `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test -race ./...` (all pass), `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`.

Follow-ups:
- None. Consider reordering the CI `Go tests` job so `Module hygiene`/`go vet`/`gofmt` run before the slow `Test` step, surfacing cheap hygiene failures first.

## 2026-06-28 — Hermetic git in cloud-sync e2e testscripts (PR #16 CI fix)

Changed:
- Made `cmd/devstrap/testdata/script/sync_materialize.txtar` and `headless_keycustody.txtar` hermetic. They passed locally but failed on CI for two environment-dependent reasons:
  - **Git identity**: CI runners have no global `user.name`/`user.email`. `git commit` auto-detects an identity on macOS but fails on Linux (`unable to auto-detect email address`), so Linux failed at the setup commit. Fixed by exporting `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`/`GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`/`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` in each script.
  - **Default branch**: `git init --bare` uses `init.defaultBranch` (defaults to `master`), but the scripts push to `main`. On a clean runner the bare HEAD pointed at `master`, so device B's blobless clone checked out an empty tree (no `README.md`) — the macOS failure. Fixed by `git init --bare -b main`.

Validated:
- Reproduced both failures locally under `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` (CI-equivalent stripped git config); both pass after the fix.
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...` — all packages pass.
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` — passed.

Follow-ups:
- Consider making devstrap materialization resolve the remote default branch authoritatively (`ls-remote --symref`) rather than trusting the cloned remote's HEAD, so a misconfigured remote HEAD never yields an empty working tree.

## 2026-06-28 — Code review fixes for cloud-sync PR (#16)

Changed:
- **C1**: Fixed HUB-04 rewrap dead code in `devices.go` — the early `return err` after the rotation warning prevented `rewrapBlobsOnRevoke` from running when `flagged > 0` (the exact case it was built for). Wrapped the warning in an `if` block so execution falls through to rewrap.
- **C2**: Added `internal/draftbundle/draftbundle_test.go` — 13 tests covering Pack/Extract round-trip, secret-file refusal (`.env`, `id_rsa`), size/file-count limit enforcement, recipient requirement, bad-identity rejection, dual-copy-on-conflict, node_modules exclusion, `.devstrap` dir skip, empty dir, nested directories, and blob-ref format.
- **I1**: Changed `ApplyEvents` to return `(int64, error)` where int64 is the max HLC of actually-inserted events; cursor now advances only past applied events, not quarantined/conflicted ones (prevents permanent loss of skipped events).
- **I3**: `hasEnrolledDevices` now only swallows the specific "no such table" error (early bootstrap); all other DB errors propagate so HUB-03 fail-closed verification is not silently downgraded.
- **I4**: `pushReferencedBlobs` returns an error when a referenced blob can't be read from local cache, preventing dangling blob references on the hub.
- **I5**: `pullReferencedBlobs` now returns `(int, error)` with a count of missing blobs; caller prints a warning so hub data loss is surfaced.
- **I6**: `draftbundle.Extract` now writes incoming files to `<name>.devstrap-conflict` on conflict instead of silently dropping them (true dual-copy per DRAFT-01).
- **M1**: Removed incorrect tar traversal guard (`filepath.Clean("/"+hdr.Name)` doesn't catch `../`); the `pathWithin` check is the real guard.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `golangci-lint run` — 0 issues
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` — passed (20 specs, 35 changed files)
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./...` — all 19 packages pass
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./internal/sync/... ./internal/draftbundle/... ./internal/cli/... ./internal/state/...` — all pass

Follow-ups:
- None (all critical and important review issues addressed)

## 2026-06-28 — Cloud-sync audit implementation: EAGER/DRAFT/HUB/XP workstreams

Changed:
- **HUB-01**: Extracted a pluggable `Hub` interface (`Push`/`Pull`/`PutBlob`/`GetBlob`) in `internal/sync/hub.go` with typed errors (`ErrSnapshotRequired`, `ErrBlobNotFound`, `ErrInvalidBlobKey`); `FileHub` now satisfies it and gains a file-backed blob plane.
- **HUB-02/HUB-06**: Added `internal/hub/r2.go` — the Cloudflare R2 zero-knowledge backend with the HUB-06 immutable object-keying scheme (`workspaces/<ws>/events/<hlc-padded>/<device>/<seq>/<id>.json`, `workspaces/<ws>/blobs/<sha256>`), conditional put, bounded `ListObjectsV2` pagination, and cursor-based pulls. S3 operations are abstracted behind an `S3Client` interface with an in-memory conformance double (`internal/hub/mems3_test.go`).
- **HUB-07/HUB-08**: Added `R2Config` with self-hosted vs hosted credential scoping (prefix-scoped temporary credentials for SaaS/runners) and explicit backend naming (file/s3-r2/http-sse) in `internal/hub/doc.go`.
- **HUB-03**: Made event verification fail-closed once enrollment exists — `verifyEventSignature` now requires valid signatures from approved devices for ALL non-local event types when any approved device is enrolled, while preserving the local device's pre-enrollment grace and the bootstrap window.
- **HUB-04**: Added `envbundle.Rewrap` (generic age re-encryption) and `rewrapBlobsOnRevoke` — on device revoke/lost, all referenced blobs are re-encrypted to the reduced recipient set and references repointed; secrets are already flagged `needs_rotation`.
- **HUB-05**: Added `gcUnreferencedBlobs` (local blob cache GC for zero-ref-count blobs) and `store.BlobRefCount`/`AllBlobRefs`/`UpdateBlobRef` methods; retention/snapshot-horizon gating noted as deferred until full-state snapshot exchange exists.
- **EAGER-01/EAGER-04**: Added eager materialization to `sync` (and a standalone `materialize` command) — after applying namespace events, bounded-concurrency (`errgroup.SetLimit(min(4, NumCPU))`) worker pool blobless-clones every skeleton `git_repo` with per-project failure isolation (mark `failed`, continue). New `internal/cli/materialize.go`.
- **EAGER-02**: Wired cursor-based incremental pull — `sync` reads `hub_cursors.last_hlc_applied` before `Pull`, passes it as `afterHLC`, and advances it after `ApplyEvents`. New migration `00008_sync_hub_cursor.sql`. Second sync with no new events pulls zero.
- **EAGER-03**: After materializing a `git_repo`, sync hydrates the project's bound env profile into `.env` (best-effort, no clobber).
- **DRAFT-01**: Added type-dispatch materialization: `git_repo` → blobless clone; `local_git`/`draft_project` → decrypt-and-extract draft bundle (or honest interim error); `plain_folder` → create skeleton directory.
- **DRAFT-02**: Added `internal/draftbundle` (tar+gzip+age pack/unpack with `.devstrapignore` allow-list, size/file-count limits, secret-file refusal, dual-copy-on-conflict extract), `draft.snapshot.created` event type + apply handler, `draft snapshot create` CLI command, blob plane push/pull in sync, and `00009_draft_snapshots.sql` migration.
- **DRAFT-03**: Added `internal/ignore` — the canonical `.devstrapignore` compiler (gitignore-compatible semantics) with one default OS-junk/build-artifact table feeding the scanner prune predicate, bundle walker, and generated `.gitignore` fragments. Scanner's `shouldPruneDir` now delegates to it.
- **DRAFT-04**: Enforced `draft_projects.max_bytes`/`max_files` during `draftbundle.Pack` with actionable error messages.
- **DRAFT-05**: Excluded `node_modules`/build artifacts from bundles via the ignore compiler; added opt-in (`DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN`-gated) post-hydrate dependency rebuild (`npm ci`/`pnpm install`/`uv sync`/`go mod download`/`cargo fetch`).
- **XP-02**: Added `devstrap run-loop` — a portable foreground ticker (scan → sync → materialize) with jittered backoff and `--once` for cron; explicitly not a daemon.
- **XP-01**: Added `sync_materialize.txtar` testscript — two-device e2e proving device B gets a real blobless clone after sync and the cursor pulls zero on a second sync.
- **XP-03**: Added `headless_keycustody.txtar` testscript — init + env capture + env hydrate with `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` and file-backed device identity.
- **XP-04**: Added `TestCrossFilesystemCaseFoldNFCInvariant` — locks down the cross-filesystem case-fold + NFC path-key collision invariant (case-only paths collide on every filesystem; NFC vs NFD normalize to the same path).
- Applied remote events now re-stamp `workspace_id` to the local workspace and create placeholder `pending` device rows so the events FK constraint is satisfied across devices.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `golangci-lint run` (v2.12.0) — 0 issues
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD` — (after spec updates)
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test ./...` — all packages pass
- `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./internal/...` — all pass

Follow-ups:
- Wire the R2 backend to a real AWS SDK v2 S3 client (the `S3Client` interface is ready; the in-memory double proves the contract).
- Build the full-state snapshot export/import wired to `ErrSnapshotRequired` before enabling retention GC.
- Add Ubuntu CI runner for the XP-01 e2e test (currently runs on macOS; the testscript is platform-portable).
- Re-enable the env blob plane push/pull for env profiles (currently only draft bundles use the blob plane in sync).

## 2026-06-28 — Solo-maintainer OSS branch policy

Changed:
- Updated `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` so the trunk-based workflow keeps required PRs, green CI, resolved conversations, linear history, and blocked force-push/deletion while removing branch-gated 1-approval and required CODEOWNERS review until a second active write-access maintainer exists.
- Kept CODEOWNERS advisory for OSS review routing, with external-contributor PRs still requiring maintainer review before merge and maintainer-authored PRs allowed to merge after green CI.
- Updated live GitHub branch protection for `main`: required status checks, strict up-to-date checks, resolved conversations, linear history, and blocked force-push/deletion remain enabled; required approval count is now 0 and required CODEOWNERS review is disabled.

Validated:
- `gh api repos/Reederey87/DevStrap/branches/main/protection` verified required checks and safety gates stayed enabled after the review-policy change.
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `git diff --check`
- `golangci-lint run`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `go test -race ./...` was attempted exactly and failed only in `internal/sync` because the local macOS keychain returned exit status 152 while storing test signing keys; `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...` passed, matching CI's headless setting.

Follow-ups:
- Re-enable 1 approving review and required CODEOWNERS review after another active maintainer with write access is available.

## 2026-06-28 — Spec/cloud architecture audit rebaseline

Changed:
- Read and reconciled the full `spec/` corpus plus `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-28.md` against live implementation and subagent findings.
- Updated spec/audit docs to mark shipped findings as closed (forge-aware PR routing, no-remote `local_git` classification, env hydration safety, keychain fallback narrowing, agent credential-env stripping), corrected planned-only schema (`device_gitstate`/`00008`), and clarified the next implementation dependency graph.
- Reworked the cloud guidance for Fly.io + Cloudflare R2 + Neon: keep the stack, add R2 immutable event-key/conditional-put/cursor semantics, temporary scoped credentials, Fly runner isolation boundaries, Neon pooled/runtime vs direct/migration DSNs, data-residency/cell planning, cost alerts, and provider alternatives.

Validated:
- `rg` stale-claim sweep across `spec/` and `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-28.md`
- `git diff --check`
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `golangci-lint run` using the CI-pinned `v2.12.0` binary installed under `/tmp` because no local `golangci-lint` was on PATH
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `go test -race ./...` was attempted exactly and failed in `internal/sync` because the local macOS keychain returned exit status 152 while storing test signing keys; `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1 go test -race ./...` passed, matching CI's headless setting.

Follow-ups:
- Implement `internal/engine` materialization extraction, `internal/hub` interface/conformance, cursor-based sync, eager `sync` materialization, `.devstrapignore` compiler, draft bundles, R2/S3 backend, fail-closed enrollment, and portable `run-loop` in the order captured by the audit addendum.

## 2026-06-28 — Dependabot policy: monthly + grouped

Changed:
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: switched both ecosystems (gomod, github-actions) from `weekly` to `monthly`, and added `groups` so each ecosystem's monthly bumps arrive as a single batched PR instead of many (reduces review churn). `open-pull-requests-limit` left at 5.
- Repo housekeeping this cycle: merged the open dependency PRs into `main` — `actions/checkout` v5→v7 (#5), `golang.org/x/text` 0.36→0.38 (#6), `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.50.1→1.53.0 (#8, rebased), `fsnotify` 1.9→1.10.1 (#9); `go build`/`go mod tidy` clean on `main`.

Validated:
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `.github/dependabot.yml` parses as valid YAML.

Follow-ups:
- `golangci/golangci-lint-action` bump (#7) still open — it edits `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which the CLI OAuth token cannot merge without the `workflow` scope; merge via the GitHub UI or grant the scope (`gh auth refresh -s workflow`).
- Dependency-only PRs currently trip the spec-drift "mapped spec unchanged" gate (go.mod maps to spec/18's `[**]`), so they need an admin merge; consider exempting dependency manifests / Dependabot authors from that gate in `internal/specdrift`.

## 2026-06-28 — Release pipeline (GoReleaser + RC flow)

Changed:
- CI/release tooling + docs; no `cmd/`/`internal/` code modified.
- Added `.goreleaser.yaml` — cross-compiles macOS + Linux (amd64/arm64) DevStrap binaries, CGO-free (pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite`), injects `version`/`commit`/`date` into `internal/cli` via `-ldflags`, emits `checksums.txt`, and marks `-rc`/`-beta`/`-alpha` tags as GitHub pre-releases (`release.prerelease: auto`).
- Added `.github/workflows/release.yml` — triggered on `v*` tags, runs GoReleaser (`contents: write`), SHA-pinned checkout/setup-go matching `ci.yml`.
- Added `RELEASING.md` — the release runbook: trunk-based release-candidate → stable flow (`vX.Y.Z-rc.N` pre-release → test the candidate binaries → promote to `vX.Y.Z`), optional `release/vX.Y` branch for stabilization/back-ports, edge install via `@main`, and keeping `main` releasable.
- Updated `spec/14` "Release and upgrade gates" to reference the automated pipeline and the RC pre-release flow.

Validated:
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- The release workflow runs only on `v*` tag pushes; it does not affect PR CI. No release is cut by merging this — releasing is a manual `v*` tag the maintainer pushes when ready.

Follow-ups:
- Pin `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` to a SHA on the next Dependabot bump (currently `@v6`).
- Optional later: Homebrew tap (already in the V1 backlog) and an edge/nightly pre-release channel.

## 2026-06-28 — Trunk-based open-source governance (branch protection + OSS files)

Changed:
- Repo governance / docs only; no `cmd/`/`internal/` code modified.
- Adopted a **trunk-based** branch model: `main` is the single protected default branch; the superseded `dev` branch was deleted. `dev`'s #3 work is fully contained in `main` (superseded by #4) and remains recoverable via PR #3 / the reflog — no work lost.
- Enabled GitHub branch protection on `main`: require a PR with 1 approving review + CODEOWNERS review; required status checks (`Spec drift`, `Go lint`, `Go tests (macos-latest)`, `Go tests (ubuntu-latest)`, `Vulnerability check`) with up-to-date branches; required conversation resolution and linear history; force-pushes and deletions blocked; `enforce_admins=false` so the solo maintainer can still merge.
- Repo merge settings: squash + rebase only (no merge commits), auto-delete head branch on merge; enabled Dependabot automated security fixes.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `spec/00_START_HERE.md` to the trunk-based fork-and-PR flow (dropped the `dev`-integration description).
- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`, and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`.

Validated:
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- Governance/docs only; Go build/test unaffected.

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-06-28 — Cloud-sync architecture: spec refresh + new audit and provisioning guide (docs only)

Changed:
- Documentation only; no `cmd/`/`internal/` code modified. Encoded the cloud-sync direction across the spec set and added two supporting docs.
- Decisions encoded: file-sync split by content type (repo content via git blobless clone — never the hub; env + non-git/draft via age-encrypted `age_blob:<sha256>` blobs; namespace map via signed HLC event log; `node_modules` rebuilt on hydrate, not synced); eager clone-everything materialization on `devstrap sync` with StrapFS/FUSE deferred; two-plane zero-knowledge `devstraphub` (event log + content-addressed encrypted blob store); Cloudflare R2 as the chosen production hub backend from the start (file-backed backend tests-only, no NAS-first phase) behind a pluggable `Hub` interface; cross-platform core first (macOS + Ubuntu), native daemon/StrapFS deferred; device-revoke re-encryption + secret rotation; fail-closed event verification (SECU-03).
- Updated `spec/00`–`spec/17` (frontmatter `last_reviewed: 2026-06-28`); added `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-28.md` to relevant `tracks_code`; added `spec/19` to the document map.
- New `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-28.md` drives the build: workstreams EAGER-* (eager-clone materialization + sync cursor), DRAFT-* (`.devstrapignore` compiler, encrypted draft bundles, non-git hydrate, node_modules rebuild), HUB-* (pluggable Hub + R2 zero-knowledge backend, fail-closed verification, device-revoke re-encryption, blob GC), XP-* (Ubuntu parity, portable scan/sync loop), SCALE-* (future multi-user: control/data-plane split, R2 per-`workspace_id`, rented microVM runner sandboxes, cell-based scaling), plus an explicit Deferred section.
- New `spec/19_CLOUD_PROVISIONING_GUIDE.md` — register/configure the chosen stack: Cloudflare R2 (storage), Fly.io (compute: control plane + ephemeral Firecracker runner microVMs), Neon (control-plane Postgres) — sign-up, resource creation, least-privilege credentials, DevStrap config via the existing encrypted-secrets path, provisioning order/checklist, credential-custody rules.
- Hosting/scaling decision: Fly.io + Cloudflare R2 + Neon (Railway/Vercel/Hetzner evaluated and rejected; reasons in `spec/03`). The LLM/Claude-API provider for the agent runner is explicitly out of scope of this cycle.

Validated:
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli -run TestEveryCommandIsDocumented` (command-doc drift green; new CLI flags/commands documented as planned)
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- No code changed this cycle, so `gofmt`/`golangci-lint`/`go test -race ./...` were not re-run.

Follow-ups:
- Implement the EAGER-*/DRAFT-*/HUB-* workstreams in a later code cycle (sync materialization + cursor, `.devstrapignore` compiler, encrypted draft bundles, R2 hub backend).
- Reconcile `dev`↔`main` divergence: `origin/dev` is behind `origin/main` and missing the merged #4 audit; this branch was based on `origin/main`.
- SCALE-* (multi-user/SaaS) remains documented-not-built.

## 2026-06-28 — Implement second-pass audit recommendations (P0 + medium severity)

Changed:
- **CI-01**: Pinned `govulncheck@v1.1.4`, moved it to its own `vuln` CI job with `continue-on-error` on PRs, added a daily scheduled run.
- **SECR-01**: `quoteDotenv` now uses POSIX single-quote rendering (literal in every dotenv loader) for values without newlines; multiline values escape `$` and backtick in addition to existing escapes. `looksInterpolated` now flags bare `$VAR` so `$`-containing values require `--literal`.
- **AGEN-02/SECU-02**: Added `childenv.AgentAllowlist()` excluding `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`; `runAgentProcess` uses it instead of `BasicAllowlist`, stripping the live SSH credential capability from agent subprocesses.
- **SECR-04/SECU-01**: `HybridStore.Ensure`/`EnsureSigning` now gate the file fallback on `IsKeychainUnavailable(err)` (exported); a present-but-failing keychain fails closed instead of silently writing a plaintext key. A `slog.Warn` fires when the file fallback is taken.
- **SYNC-05/CODE-01**: `ApplyEvents` now `continue`s after recording a hash-chain-break conflict (was `return err`), so the rest of the batch converges.
- **CODE-02**: Removed volatile `OffsetMS` from persisted `skewConflictDetails` so re-delivered skewed events dedup instead of inserting duplicate conflict rows.
- **SYNC-03**: Added lower-bound HLC validation (`event.HLC <= 0` → quarantine) with an `epochFloorMS` constant.
- **CODE-03**: `Store.WithTx` now uses `defer tx.Rollback()` so a panic inside the closure returns the connection to the single-connection pool.
- **CODE-04**: `writeEnvBlob` uses a named return + deferred Close observation + `file.Sync()` for durability of the encrypted blob.
- **CODE-05**: `state.Open` now takes `ctx context.Context`, uses `db.PingContext(ctx)`, and passes `ctx` to `foreignKeyCheck`; all callers updated.
- **SECR-02**: Hydrated env files now begin with the spec-mandated `# Generated by DevStrap. Do not commit.` header with profile name and timestamp.
- **SECR-05**: `env hydrate` now calls `ensureIgnored` before writing the secret content, so the file is gitignored the instant it exists.
- **SECU-04**: `redact.Writer` now suppresses multi-line PEM private key blocks across line boundaries (BEGIN to `[REDACTED PRIVATE KEY]`, body lines dropped until END).
- **AGEN-01**: `enforceAgentCommandPolicy` now blocks known interpreters/shells/downloaders (sh, bash, python*, node, curl, etc.) under non-yolo policies; `--policy` help text disclaims advisory-only scope.
- **AGEN-04**: Added `ephemeral-ci` to accepted policy profiles; replaced `>` substring check with argv-aware redirection detection.
- **AGEN-05**: `agentTokenLooksSensitive` now includes `credentials.json`, `service-account*.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`; deny list expanded with `/.kube`, `/.docker`.
- **AGEN-06**: Agent PR body now scrubbed through `redact.Scrub` before forge submission.
- **NOVCS-01**: Scanner classifies no-remote/unvalidated-remote git repos as `local_git` (new `TypeLocalGit` constant) instead of `git_repo`, preventing broken cross-device namespace entries.
- **NOVCS-04**: `createFreshWorktree` preflights `project.RemoteKey == ""` with an actionable error before touching git.
- **FORGE-01**: New `internal/cli/forge.go` with `DetectForge(remoteURL)`, `forgeTokenEnv(kind)`, `createForgePR` routing to `gh`/`glab`/`tea` based on detected forge; unknown forges get graceful degradation (branch + compare URL).
- **FORGE-02**: PR env allowlist is now forge-aware (GH_*/GITLAB_TOKEN/GLAB_*/GITEA_TOKEN/TEA_*/BITBUCKET_*/AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT).
- **FORGE-03**: `normalizeHostPath` now unifies Azure DevOps SSH (`ssh.dev.azure.com/v3/`) and HTTPS (`dev.azure.com/_git/`) forms to `dev.azure.com/org/proj/repo`.
- **SECU-03**: `verifyEventSignature` now requires valid signatures from known approved devices for destructive event types (`project.deleted`, `project.renamed`); unknown devices and non-local devices without signing keys are rejected for these types.
- **SECU-05**: `devices enroll --approve` now requires `--signing-public-key`.
- **SYNC-01**: Same-remote `project.added`/`updated` now checks HLC-dominance before upserting; a stale event (stored coords dominate incoming) is a no-op so convergence is deterministic.
- **GIT-01**: `repoLockIsStale` now treats same-host liveness as authoritative over age; a live PID is never declared stale regardless of `acquired_at`.
- **CLI-02**: `scan --quarantine` progress lines now go to stderr, preserving valid JSON on stdout.
- **CLI-03**: `run` and `agent run` now propagate child exit codes as `100+N` (new `childExitBase`).
- **CLI-04**: Added `exitUsage = 10` for bad-flag/missing-flag/arg-count errors.
- **PROD-01**: Added `deriveDisplayStatus` function mapping materialization+dirty states to user-facing labels; `status` output uses it.
- **PROD-02**: New `devstrap conflicts` command listing open conflicts; `status` shows open-conflict count.
- **DATA-01**: `Backup()` now validates the backup with `PRAGMA quick_check` + `foreignKeyCheck` after `VACUUM INTO`; removes the partial backup on failure.
- **TEST-04**: Removed gosec `includes` allowlist (all rules now run), added `errorlint`, set `max-same-issues: 0`; fixed two `errorlint` findings in `platform.go`.
- **ARCH2-04**: Added `// reserved for M5 daemon` comment on `exitDaemonUnavailable`.
- Updated affected tests for new quoting, interpreter blocking, signing-key requirement, forge-agnostic PR, and context-threaded `Open`.

Validated:
- Exa best-practice research for dotenv safe quoting (single-quote literal), SSH agent forwarding risks, keychain fail-closed patterns, govulncheck CI pinning, and forge abstraction (git-pkgs/forge precedent).
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `go build ./...`
- `go vet ./...`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run` (0 issues)
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./...`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

Follow-ups:
- Remaining audit items not yet implemented: ARCH2-01 (extract `internal/engine`), ARCH2-02 (wire sync cursors), SYNC-02 (collapse HLC implementations), SYNC-04 (wire event_delivery), GIT-02..05, CLI-01 (thread --json through all commands), CLI-05 (daemon socket security spec), PROD-03 (draft limits), PROD-04/05 (spec re-baselining), DATA-02..06, TEST-01..03/05/06, PLAT-01..05, CODE-06, SECR-03/06, NOVCS-02/03/05, FORGE-04/05, and all spec-only fixes (ARCH2-03/05, etc.).
- Update all `spec/` files to reflect implemented changes (deferred to spec review pass).

## 2026-06-27 — Second-pass design & implementation audit + full spec refresh

Changed:
- Added `AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026-06-27.md` (repo root): a second-pass audit with Executive Summary, Priority Matrix, and 6 sections — CI/CD (`CI-01`), non-VCS/remote-less projects (`NOVCS-01..05`), non-GitHub forges (`FORGE-01..05`), 65 verified cross-dimension findings across 12 dimensions (incl. `ARCH2-*`), cross-machine working-state sync design (3-layer git-native plane), and zero-knowledge sync-hub architecture & services. Findings carry file:line evidence, examples, and actionable steps.
- Updated every `spec/` file to incorporate the new ideas and correct drift: `00` (phases = capability grouping, current position, plane separation), `01` (Alternatives F/G; reject continuous file-sync; architecture rules 7–8), `03` (engine seam `ARCH2-01`, hub HTTP/SSE, reconciler wording `ARCH2-04`), `04` (file-sync rejection + working-state/non-VCS/forge challenges), `07` (`local_git` type + content-sync table, `repo.gitstate.observed`/`repo.wip.pushed` events, working-state plane, HTTP/SSE wire protocol, cursor status `ARCH2-02`), `08` (forge-agnostic provider section, remote-less preflight `NOVCS-04`, WIP-ref base prohibition), `09` (`SECR-01/02/05` hydration safety), `10` (agent-isolation reality `AGEN-01..06`/`SECU-02`, forge-agnostic PR), `12` (`device_gitstate` table, `git_repos` remote-key constraint, dead-table notes), `14` (audit follow-ups + workstreams), `15` (agent/hub reality `SECU-01/03`, audit-log-unimplemented note), and targeted follow-up sections in `02/05/06/11/13/16/17`. Added ADR `0002-working-state-sync.md`. Bumped `last_reviewed` to 2026-06-27.
- No Go code changed this cycle (audit + specs only).

Validated:
- Exa best-practice research across the 12 audit dimensions plus dedicated working-state-sync and sync-architecture design workflows (git-corruption/file-sync consensus, HLC/CRDT, age/SOPS, forge abstraction, SSE/transport, zero-knowledge hub).
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`; `go build ./...`; `go test ./...` (unaffected — no code change).

Follow-ups:
- P0 implementation: agent isolation hardening (`AGEN-01/02`), secret-hydration escaping (`SECR-01`), key-custody fallback narrowing (`SECR-04`), forge-agnostic PR (`FORGE-01`), no-remote classification (`NOVCS-01`), CI `govulncheck` pinning/split (`CI-01`).
- Build the working-state validation plane (Layer A) and wire the sync cursor (`ARCH2-02`).
- The spec-update pass was done via direct edits because subagent workflows were session-rate-limited at the time; a workflow re-pass can refine after the reset.

## 2026-06-26 — Audit recommendations: security, sync, git, secrets, tests, specs

Changed:
- Added `internal/redact`: a `Secret` capability type (String/GoString/MarshalText/MarshalJSON/LogValue all render `[REDACTED]`, single `Reveal` boundary), `URL`/`StripURLUserinfo` helpers, a token-shape `Scrub`, a value `Redactor`, and a line-buffering scrubbing `Writer` (ENV-2/SEC-3). Wired it into sync event remote-URL stripping, CLI error printing, the persisted agent log stream, and slog value-level redaction.
- Hardened the scan→adopt→hydrate boundary: scan only persists validated remotes (SEC-1); escaping symlinks are typed (`ErrEscape`/`ErrDangling`), hard-excluded, and conflict-recorded, with use-time revalidation (`pathkey.VerifyWithinRoot`) before hydrate/worktree materialization (SEC-4); added `scan --quarantine` to move secret-looking files into a dated `0600` quarantine (SEC-6).
- Implemented layered default-branch resolution (`ResolveDefaultBranch` with `remote set-head --auto` repair + typed source; `RemoteDefaultBranch` via `ls-remote --symref`), used authoritatively by `worktree new` with a non-authoritative warning (GIT-2).
- Wired the HLC clock-skew guard into `ApplyEvents`: far-future remote events are quarantined as `untrustworthy_remote_time` conflicts (not applied, batch continues) and accepted events advance the local clock via `ReceiveRemoteHLC` (SYNC-3).
- Implemented `project.renamed` (re-key with target-collision conflict), delete-vs-dirty (`pending_delete_conflict` instead of destroying a dirty checkout), and `GCTombstones` (SYNC-5).
- Hardened `worktree cleanup` (distinguish dirty-state errors from dirty trees, skipped count, `--force`) (GIT-3); added `worktree unlock <path>` + `doctor` lock reporting with `readRepoLock`/`clearRepoLock` helpers (SEC-5/OP-UNLOCK/OP-DOCTOR-LOCK).
- Added `secret_bindings.needs_rotation` (migration 00007), `MarkEncryptedBindingsNeedingRotation`/`CountSecretBindingsNeedingRotation`, device revoke/lost rotation flagging, and `doctor` reporting (ENV-4).
- Added a `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN` platform gate forcing the file-backed key store for headless/CI and hermetic e2e tests.
- Added tests: scan classification + unvalidated-remote + quarantine (TEST-1), pathkey case/symlink/verify (TEST-2), worktree HEAD/base-SHA + stale-local assertions (TEST-3), JSON-contract unmarshal assertions (TEST-5), HLC backward-clock/tick/concurrency (SYNC-1/TEST-7), git timeout/ResolveDefaultBranch/DirtyState (GO-1/GIT-2/GIT-6), logger no-ctx + token scrub (GO-6), sync skew/rename/delete-vs-dirty/GC, redact unit tests, and a `testscript` end-to-end harness covering `cmd/devstrap` through the real binary (TEST-6).
- Added a `spec/13` command-doc drift test (SPEC-5), `spec/adr/0001-product-naming.md` (SPEC-3), an `internal/sync/doc.go` spike note (ARCH-2), and spec updates for naming, branch workflow, status JSON, no-daemon guarantee, roadmap gates, single-writer/manifest-hub notes, and the newest-first work-log rule (SPEC-2/3/4/6, ARCH-1/2).
- Hardening from CI/review: a review subagent caught and fixed two real bugs — `StripURLUserinfo` was dropping the ssh `git@` login (would break peer clones) and `VerifyWithinRoot` rejected nested not-yet-created hydration targets; added a `git` `WaitDelay` backstop and broadened keychain-unavailable detection so a missing Secret Service degrades to the file store; set `DEVSTRAP_NO_KEYCHAIN=1` in the CI test job; and bumped the Go toolchain `1.25.7 -> 1.26.4` to clear pre-existing stdlib CVEs that `govulncheck` flagged in CI (code is not affected on 1.26.4).

Validated:
- Exa best-practice research for slog redaction capability types, git default-branch resolution (`ls-remote --symref` / `set-head --auto`), HLC receive/skew semantics, CRDT rename/move, Go 1.24 `os.Root` TOCTOU defense, OWASP secret quarantine, SOPS+age revocation/value rotation, and `rogpeppe/go-internal` testscript.
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`
- `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`
- `go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`
- `go mod tidy`

Follow-ups:
- Implement automatic remote device enrollment, fingerprint confirmation, and bundle re-encryption (envelope rewrap to remaining recipients + superseded-blob deletion) on revoke.
- Add OS-enforced agent sandboxing/project-env allowlists and non-generic agent engine adapters.
- Implement service installers and evaluate a native FSEvents watcher; wire tombstone GC to approved sync-cursor watermarks once cursor tracking lands.
- Accepted-for-now (raised in review): the local `git_repos.remote_url` keeps any embedded credential so local hydrate still works with credential-in-URL setups (the synced event strips it, so no cross-device/hub leak); and the agent-log scrubber is line-buffered, so a multi-line PEM body echoed by a tool is only header-matched in the owner-only `0600` log.

## 2026-06-26 — Provider env file hydration

Changed:
- Extended `devstrap env hydrate` so 1Password provider profiles resolve `op://` refs through `op inject` into a temporary `0600` file, then install the requested target through the existing atomic write and overwrite guard.
- Added CLI coverage with a fake `op` for provider `run`, provider `hydrate`, output mode `0600`, `.gitignore` updates, and overwrite refusal before secrets are resolved.
- Added `devstrap agent run/list/show/pr` for the thin generic runner: fresh worktree creation, sanitized no-secret command env, wrapper-level command policy profiles, `0600` logs, persisted `agent_runs`, Git status/diff summaries, and stale-base-gated PR dry-run/create flow.
- Added integration coverage for agent policy denial, run metadata, log capture, diff summary, and `agent pr` stale-base refusal/override.
- Added `devstrap devices list/approve/revoke/lost/rename`, state helpers for device trust-state changes, local-device revocation refusal, and CLI coverage for list/rename/refusal behavior.
- Added `devstrap sync --hub-file` for the file-backed test hub, including namespace-only/dry-run output and CLI coverage for the dry-run path.
- Stabilized fake-Git error-classification tests under race instrumentation by increasing their test-only subprocess timeout.
- Re-sequenced the roadmap/spec recommendation so the thin agent runner milestone follows the fresh worktree manager instead of waiting behind daemon, Linux, and hub work.
- Added the trust-plane dependency gate before hub encrypted-blob sync and clarified that device revocation requires secret value rotation in addition to bundle re-encryption.
- Updated README and affected start-here, architecture, Mac/Linux, secrets/env, agent, security, SQLite data-model, CLI/API, roadmap, and test-plan specs after reviewing the spec folder.

Validated:
- Exa best-practice research for 1Password `op inject --file-mode 0600`, `op run --env-file`, and provider-reference workflows.

- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

Follow-ups:
- Continue remaining audit items: OS keychain/approval, native watcher/service adapters, agent file policy enforcement, non-generic agent adapters, and real PR execution smoke tests with `gh`.

## 2026-06-26 — Agent file policy and native watcher hardening

Changed:
- Added wrapper-level agent file path policy for non-`yolo-local` runs, denying explicit sensitive-path and outside-worktree arguments before the generic agent command executes.
- Added non-dry `devstrap agent pr` coverage with a fake `gh` executable to verify `gh pr create` receives the expected base/head/title/body argv after the stale-base gate.
- Added an fsnotify-backed Darwin/Linux watcher adapter that recursively watches directories, skips generated trees, debounces bursty filesystem events, and emits reconciliation hints through the existing platform interface.
- Updated README and reviewed/updated every spec file so implementation status, roadmap items, security notes, test plan, and references reflect the new agent policy and watcher behavior.

Validated:
- Exa best-practice research for OS keychain storage, fsnotify watcher semantics/debouncing, agent sandbox/file policy layering, and hermetic `gh pr create` testing.
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `go test ./internal/cli ./internal/platform`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.0 run`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go run ./cmd/spec-drift --base origin/main --head HEAD`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

Follow-ups:
- Implement automatic remote device enrollment, fingerprint confirmation, and bundle re-encryption hooks.
- Add OS-enforced agent sandboxing/project-env allowlists and non-generic agent engine adapters.
- Implement service installers and evaluate whether the Darwin fsnotify/kqueue watcher should be replaced by a native FSEvents adapter.

## 2026-06-26 — OS keychain-backed device identities

Changed:
- Added a platform `SystemKeychain` adapter backed by `github.com/zalando/go-keyring`, using macOS Keychain on Darwin and Secret Service/keyring on Linux through the existing platform seam.
- Added a `devicekeys.HybridStore` that prefers OS keychain storage for age X25519 and Ed25519 private identities and falls back to the existing `0600` file store when the keyring is unavailable.
- Wired init, env hydrate/run, doctor, and local event signing through the hybrid store so private identities remain out of SQLite/config while using OS-protected storage when available.
- Added mocked keyring and hybrid-store coverage so tests do not touch the developer's real keychain.
- Updated README and all affected specs to mark OS keychain/Secret Service storage implemented with file fallback and to keep remote approval as the remaining trust-plane gap.

Validated:
- Exa best-practice research for OS keychain/Secret Service storage, documented file fallback behavior, and mocked keyring tests.

## 2026-06-26 — Manual device approval for env recipients

Changed:
- Added `devstrap devices enroll <device-id>` with required name, OS, arch, age recipient, optional signing public key, and `--approve` support for manually registering remote device records.
- Added `state.UpsertDevice` for non-local device enrollment while refusing to overwrite the current local device identity.
- Changed encrypted env capture to include the local age recipient plus approved remote device age recipients, excluding pending/revoked/lost devices.
- Added CLI coverage proving an approved remote device can decrypt a captured env blob and that capture reports the recipient count.
- Updated README and affected specs to mark manual per-device env-decryption approval implemented while keeping automatic enrollment, fingerprint confirmation, and bundle re-encryption as future production hub work.

## 2026-06-26 — Add/adopt sync event emission

Changed:
- Fixed `devstrap add` and `scan --adopt` so local namespace writes also stamp signed local project events for `devstrap sync --hub-file` to push.
- Recorded local namespace source-event HLC/device/id metadata when add/adopt writes project rows.
- Added CLI regression coverage that scan-adopted projects appear in `sync --hub-file --dry-run` as pending local events.
- Updated sync and test-plan specs to document add/adopt event emission.

Validated:
- Code review subagent identified the missing add/adopt event emission as a high-severity blocker before commit.

## 2026-06-25 — Local age device identity

Changed:
- Added `filippo.io/age` and a local `internal/devicekeys` file-backed age X25519 identity store.
- `devstrap init` now ensures the local device has an age identity, persists only the public recipient in `devices.public_key`, and keeps the private identity in `~/.devstrap/keys/<device_id>.agekey` with mode `0600`.
- `devstrap doctor` now reports whether the local age public recipient and age private identity match.
- Threaded device `public_key` through the state API and added a public-key update method.
- Added coverage for key generation/reuse, init persistence, doctor status, and absence of the private identity from `state.db` and `config.yaml`.
- Updated affected secrets, threat-model, data-model, platform, CLI/API, roadmap, start-here, and test-plan specs.

## 2026-06-25 — Stale-base finalization gate

Changed:
- Added `devstrap worktree finalize <id>` as the pre-PR/handoff freshness gate.
- Reused the recorded worktree `base_ref`/`base_sha` drift check so finalization exits with a conflict when the remote base moved unless `--allow-stale-base` is explicitly passed.
- Extended the worktree integration test to assert stale-base refusal and explicit stale override.

## 2026-06-25 — Git LFS policy for agent worktrees

Changed:
- Threaded `git_repos.lfs_policy` through project reads and added `devstrap add --lfs-policy auto|never|agent|always`.
- Added `.gitattributes`-based Git LFS detection and policy-aware agent worktree handling: `agent`/`always` runs `git lfs pull`; `auto`/`never` warns about pointer files.
- Preserved existing LFS policy when project metadata upserts omit the field.
- Added Git, state, and CLI coverage for LFS detection, policy preservation, invalid policy rejection, and agent worktree pointer warnings.
- Updated README and affected Git, CLI/API, roadmap, start-here, and test-plan specs.

## 2026-06-25 — Order-independent path conflict reconcile

Changed:
- Added namespace source-event metadata so sync replay can compare the event coordinates that currently own an active namespace entry.
- Made same-path/different-remote replay deterministic across pull windows by selecting the lowest `(hlc, device_id, event_id)` winner and writing a stable conflict keyed by the unordered remote-key pair.
- Added commutativity and late-arriving-winner tests, plus an open-conflict read helper for assertions.

## 2026-06-25 — Local event signatures

Changed:
- Added local Ed25519 device signing identities alongside age recipients, storing only the signing public key in SQLite and private signing material in the `0600` key directory.
- Signed locally inserted events over canonical event fields and verified signed event inserts when the source device signing public key is known.
- Extended `devstrap init` and `doctor` to provision and check both age and signing identities.
- Added state, CLI, and device-key coverage for signing key persistence, signature reuse, tamper rejection, and absence of private signing material from `state.db`/`config.yaml`.
- Updated affected data model, security, env/device trust, roadmap, API, platform, start-here, and test-plan specs.

## 2026-06-25 — Shared child environment sanitizer

Changed:
- Added `internal/childenv`, an allowlist-based child process environment builder with non-overridable dangerous-name stripping for dynamic linker, interpreter, shell, and Git injection variables.
- Wired Git subprocesses through the shared sanitizer and centralized Git protocol policy on every invocation with an explicit protocol allowlist, denied `ext`, disabled prompts, isolated global/system config, and controlled SSH batch mode via `core.sshCommand`.
- Wired editor launches through the same sanitized child environment and separated path arguments with `--`.
- Added focused child-env and Git tests for inherited-secret stripping, dangerous variable blocking, controlled Git env, and secure argument policy.
- Updated affected start-here, env, agent policy, security, test-plan, and README docs.

## 2026-06-25 — Worktree stale-remove prune

Changed:
- Added Git runner helpers for `git worktree remove` and `git worktree prune`.
- Added project lookup by namespace ID so worktree removal can run from the main checkout instead of the linked worktree path.
- Added `devstrap worktree remove <id> --force`; missing manually deleted worktree paths now require force, run `git worktree prune`, and mark the DB row removed.
- Updated `cleanup --merged` to prune missing stale worktree paths and remove their active DB rows.
- Extended CLI coverage for manually deleted worktree removal and updated affected Git/worktree, CLI/API, agent policy, roadmap, and test-plan specs.

## 2026-06-25 — Encrypted env capture

Changed:
- Added `internal/envfile`, a side-effect-free dotenv parser with explicit grammar, optional `export`, quoted/unquoted comment handling, dangerous-name rejection, size guard, and interpolation refusal unless literal mode is explicit.
- Added `internal/envbundle` to age-encrypt parsed env bindings to device recipients and return content-addressed `age_blob:<sha256>` refs.
- Added `devstrap env capture <path> <env-file> [--literal] [--profile]`; capture reads the env file once, encrypts in memory to the local age recipient, writes a `0600` ciphertext blob under `~/.devstrap/blobs`, stores only encrypted refs in SQLite, and gitignores captured files inside the project.
- Added state helpers for saving and reading captured encrypted env profiles and bindings.
- Added parser, encryption, state, and CLI coverage proving plaintext values are absent from `state.db`, `config.yaml`, and ciphertext blobs.
- Updated affected README, start-here, secrets/env, CLI/API, roadmap, and test-plan specs.

## 2026-06-25 — Encrypted env hydrate

Changed:
- Added age bundle decrypt support and `devstrap env hydrate <path> --write <file> [--force]`.
- Hydrate resolves the captured encrypted env profile, reads the local `age_blob:<sha256>` ciphertext, decrypts it with the local device age identity, renders dotenv output, writes atomically with mode `0600`, refuses existing targets unless `--force`, and gitignores the hydrated target.
- Extended env CLI coverage for hydrate success, `0600` file mode, gitignore updates, overwrite refusal, and forced overwrite.
- Updated affected README, start-here, secrets/env, CLI/API, Mac/Linux, threat-model, roadmap, test-plan, and work-log specs.

## 2026-06-25 — Platform adapter seams

Changed:
- Added `internal/platform` with concrete interfaces for watcher, service manager, keychain, and editor launch.
- Added build-tagged platform detection, a polling watcher fallback, explicit unsupported service/keychain placeholders, and a platform-owned runtime OS/arch helper.
- Routed `devstrap open` through the platform editor adapter while preserving detached launch and sanitized child environment behavior.
- Added platform tests for detection, polling watcher cancellation, unsupported-adapter sentinel errors, and a source guard that keeps `runtime.GOOS` branching inside `internal/platform`.
- Updated affected README, start-here, architecture, Linux, roadmap, and test-plan specs.

## 2026-06-25 — Generated workspace identity

Changed:
- Replaced store/query hardcoding of the local workspace id with a generated, persisted `ws_` workspace identity.
- Added migration `00006_workspace_singleton.sql` to enforce the Phase 0 single-workspace invariant at the database layer.
- Threaded the resolved workspace id through state transactions, project queries, tombstones, env profiles, conflicts, and event insertion.
- Removed `ws_local` from sync test event construction so local apply uses the persisted workspace identity.
- Added coverage for generated workspace id persistence, singleton rejection, concurrent `EnsureWorkspace`, and event workspace inheritance.

## 2026-06-25 — CI lint and gosec gate

Changed:
- Added root `.golangci.yml` enabling `errcheck`, `gosec`, `govet`, `ineffassign`, `staticcheck`, and `unconvert`.
- Added a separate pinned `golangci-lint-action` CI job using golangci-lint v2.12.
- Fixed lint findings for unchecked close/rollback paths, stale test assignments, and staticcheck control flow/style issues.
- Added narrow `nolint:gosec` annotations for intentionally variable git/editor subprocesses, managed repo-lock paths, user-selected env paths, and public project skeleton files.
- Documented `golangci-lint run` in `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the Phase 0 test-plan gate; added lint references to `spec/17_REFERENCES.md`.

## 2026-06-25 — SQLite foreign-key integrity checks

Changed:

- Changed `clone` and `fetch` to retry transient network failures only, leaving auth, branch, and remote errors non-retried.
- Mapped typed Git errors to existing CLI exit codes for auth, network, and generic Git failures.
- Normalized explicit SSH ports out of `ssh://` and scp-like remotes, and tightened malformed scp-like remote validation.
- Added Git tests for typed classification, retry/no-retry behavior, port normalization, and CLI exit-code mapping.

## 2026-06-24 — Audit hardening and spec refresh

Changed:
- Hardened the SQLite state layer with DSN pragmas, WAL, busy timeout, single-writer pool, secure DB permissions, backup/status helpers, and reversible event-ordering migrations.
- Added `devstrap db migrate/status/backup/down` and tests for CLI, config, state, migration, and status behavior.
- Hardened CI with read-only permissions, SHA-pinned actions, vet/build/race tests, vuln scanning, module hygiene, and a guard against vacuous package tests.
- Renamed the repository default branch to `main`, removed legacy branch-name references, and documented local clone update steps.
- Reviewed and updated all files under `spec/` for current implementation state, local-first sync design, SQLite behavior, secrets/security, platform service behavior, scan scale, release/backup gates, and future web/admin surface best practices.

## 2026-06-24 — Work-log process requirement

Changed:
- Added this tracking file.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to require concise end-of-cycle summaries in this file after codebase-modifying work.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to require a final spec-folder review/update after the last codebase modification in a session.
- Added this file to the `spec/00_START_HERE.md` document map.

Follow-ups:
- None.

## 2026-06-24 — Scan, Git hydration, sync spike, and worktrees

Changed:
- Added redacted structured logging, generated `dev_<uuidv7>` IDs, stable local device persistence, namespace path normalization, and expanded state-store methods for projects, events, conflicts, and worktrees.
- Implemented `devstrap scan`, `add`, `hydrate`, `open`, and `worktree new/status/list/remove/cleanup`, including skeleton directories, partial clone by default, local bare remote support, dirty-target refusal, duplicate remote reporting, and fresh upstream worktree base resolution.
- Added `internal/git`, `internal/scan`, `internal/pathkey`, and `internal/sync` primitives for remote normalization, bounded scanner pruning, HLC ordering, idempotent event replay, conflict creation, and a file-backed test hub.
- Updated README and affected specs to reflect implemented commands and remaining daemon/env/hub follow-ups.

- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./...`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go vet ./...`

- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go mod tidy`
- `git diff --check`

Follow-ups:
- Add a user-facing `devstrap sync` command, remote device registration/approval, full snapshot fallback, and real skeleton reconciliation across roots.
- Enforce stale-base checks before PR/finalization workflows once that lifecycle command exists.
- Implement env run, daemon/watchers, and agent runner policy enforcement.

## 2026-06-24 — Git and HLC audit hardening

Changed:
- Hardened git subprocess execution with bounded default timeouts, disabled prompts, sanitized environment, protocol policy, remote URL validation, `--` separators for clone/worktree add, explicit default-branch errors, and URL credential redaction in git errors.
- Added `devstrap worktree status <id>` plus reusable base-drift detection that re-fetches the recorded base ref and reports fresh vs stale state.
- Reworked the HLC implementation to use a mutex, explicit physical/logical packing, 16-bit logical overflow handling, and max-skew rejection.
- Updated README and affected specs after reviewing the spec folder for stale command, HLC, security, test-plan, and roadmap text.

- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/git ./internal/sync ./internal/scan ./internal/cli`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/git ./internal/cli`

- spec stale-text sweep for worktree status, default-branch fallback, logger context, and HLC wording.

Follow-ups:
- Continue remaining audit items: env run, OS keychain/approval, agent policy enforcement, and future PR command integration.

## 2026-06-24 — Transactional sync event apply

Changed:
- Added a state transaction facade and switched sync replay to claim each event and apply project/conflict side effects in the same SQLite transaction.
- Event insertion now computes/verifies payload content hashes, treats exact duplicate deliveries as no-ops, rejects divergent reuse of an event ID, and stores absent per-device sequence numbers as `NULL` instead of colliding on `seq=0`.
- Made conflict insertion idempotent for identical open conflicts and added deterministic `(hlc, device_id, id)` event ordering in the store, sync replay, and file-backed hub.
- Removed mutable delivery/apply state from the insert-only `events` schema; delivery state remains in `event_delivery`.
- Updated affected specs after reviewing sync/data schema text and test-plan coverage.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state ./internal/sync`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

## 2026-06-24 — Unicode path and scan safety coverage

Changed:
- Normalized namespace paths to Unicode NFC before validation, display storage, and case-folded key generation.
- Added direct `internal/scan` coverage for generated-directory pruning, secret-looking filename warnings, symlink escape warnings, duplicate remote reporting, and avoiding descent into pruned Git repos.
- Made `golang.org/x/text` a direct dependency for Unicode normalization.
- Updated affected specs after reviewing path normalization, scanner safety, and test-plan text.

- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/pathkey ./internal/scan`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go mod tidy`

## 2026-06-24 — Repo operation lock hardening

Changed:
- Replaced bare repo lockfiles with metadata-backed lock records containing PID, hostname, and acquisition time.
- Added stale lock recovery for dead same-host owners and over-age lockfiles, with double-read removal before deleting stale markers.
- Put `hydrate` under the per-project repo operation lock and changed `worktree new` to hold the same lock through hydrate, fetch, default-branch update, and worktree creation.
- Added CLI tests for active lock refusal and stale-owner reclamation.
- Updated affected specs and reconciled older work-log follow-ups that still listed repo lock extension as remaining.

- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

## 2026-06-24 — Open command and init detection hardening

Changed:
- Changed `devstrap open` to start `cursor`/`code` without binding the editor lifetime to the CLI context and to release the child process handle after launch.
- Replaced uninitialized SQLite detection based on `"no such table"` string matching with explicit `sqlite_master` table checks.
- Expanded state tests so summary, current-device, and project-list reads all return `ErrNotInitialized` before migrations.
- Updated affected CLI/API and test-plan specs.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/cli ./internal/state`

## 2026-06-24 — Persisted local event clock

Changed:
- Added `device_sync_state` to persist each local device's last HLC and next sequence number.
- Added `Store.InsertLocalEvent`, which stamps local events with the current local device, monotonic HLC, and per-device sequence in the same SQLite transaction that inserts the event.
- Added `sync.CreateProjectEvent` for local project events so callers no longer need to supply HLC/sequence manually.
- Seeded missing local clock state from existing max local `events` rows to avoid timestamp or sequence regression after restart or partial state loss.
- Added state and sync tests for persisted HLC/sequence behavior across reopen and for local project event creation.
- Updated affected specs and reconciled work-log follow-ups that still listed persisted HLC state as remaining.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state ./internal/sync`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test -race ./...`

## 2026-06-24 — HLC-gated project tombstones

Changed:
- Implemented `project.deleted` replay as an HLC-stamped namespace tombstone instead of an immediate purge.
- Added tombstone checks so older `project.added`/`project.updated` events are ignored and newer add/update events restore the project.
- Reset tombstones when a newer active project event wins.
- Added sync replay coverage for delete plus older/newer restore ordering.
- Updated affected specs and reconciled work-log follow-ups that still listed tombstone/delete semantics as remaining.

Validated:
- `gofmt -w cmd internal`
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/devstrap-gocache go test ./internal/state ./internal/sync`
