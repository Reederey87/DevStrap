# Namespace and Sync Model

## Core abstraction

The core object is a **namespace entry**.

A namespace entry maps a stable relative path to an intention:

```text
work/nclh/foc-models → Git repo at git@github.com:org/foc-models.git
experiments/fs2      → encrypted draft project
personal/scripts     → plain managed folder
```

The path is the product.

## Namespace entry example

```yaml
id: prj_01jz8devstrapabc
path: work/nclh/foc-models
type: git_repo
remote: git@github.com:org/foc-models.git
default_branch: main
materialization_policy: lazy
env_profile: snowflake-dev
tooling_profile: python-uv-snowflake
agent_policy: guarded
ignore_profile: default-code
created_at: 2026-06-23T12:00:00Z
updated_at: 2026-06-23T12:00:00Z
```

## Project types

### `git_repo`

Normal managed Git project.

Content source:

```text
Git remote
```

DevStrap syncs:

```text
path, remote, branch, profiles, state
```

DevStrap does not sync:

```text
working tree bytes, .git internals, dependencies
```

### `draft_project`

Small project without remote Git yet.

Content source:

```text
encrypted DevStrap draft bundle
```

Use for:

- experiments;
- scratch tools;
- early prototypes.

Limits:

```text
100 MB default max
5,000 files default max
ignore rules always applied
no plaintext secret files
```

### `plain_folder`

Structure-only folder.

Use for:

- grouping folders;
- documentation buckets;
- local-only areas.

## Device state

Each device has local state for every namespace entry.

Example:

```yaml
device_id: dev_macmini_upstairs
path: work/nclh/foc-models
state: ready
local_path: /Users/artem/Code/work/nclh/foc-models
current_branch: main
last_fetch_sha: abc123
local_dirty: false
env_ready: true
tooling_ready: true
last_seen_at: 2026-06-23T12:03:00Z
```

## Materialization states

DevStrap stores readiness as an orthogonal tuple, not one overloaded string:

```text
materialization_state: skeleton | hydrating | available | failed
dirty_state:           unknown | clean | dirty | ahead | behind | diverged | conflicted
env_ready:             true | false
tooling_ready:         true | false
```

Display status is derived from that tuple:

```text
conflicted  dirty_state=conflicted
failed      materialization_state=failed
skeleton    materialization_state=skeleton
hydrating   materialization_state=hydrating
dirty       dirty_state=dirty|ahead|diverged
current     materialization_state=available && dirty_state=clean
ready       current && env_ready && tooling_ready
```

## Event log

DevStrap sync should use append-only events.

Event fields:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_01jz...",
  "workspace_id": "ws_01jz...",
  "device_id": "dev_macmini_upstairs",
  "seq": 42,
  "hlc": 115763879690240001,
  "type": "project.added",
  "payload": {},
  "content_hash": "sha256:...",
  "device_sig": "ed25519:...",
  "prev_event_hash": "sha256:...",
  "created_at": "2026-06-23T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Rows in `events` are insert-only. Delivery/apply state lives in `event_delivery`, and per-peer progress lives in `sync_cursors`; implementations must not update event payload, HLC, signatures, or hashes in place. Local event creation links each sequential same-device event to the previous event content hash before signing. Incoming events with a non-empty `prev_event_hash` must match the previous same-device event already present locally; a missing or mismatched predecessor is treated as a hash-chain break and recorded as an `event_hash_chain_break` conflict.

## Clock and ordering

Events are ordered by a Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC), not by wall-clock timestamps.

Rules:

```text
1. created_at is display-only and MUST NOT resolve conflicts.
2. seq is per-device monotonic and used for gap detection.
3. Global replay order is ORDER BY hlc ASC, device_id ASC, id ASC.
4. Apply is idempotent on event_id; duplicate deliveries are no-ops.
5. Incoming events whose causal marker does not descend from the local version are concurrent.
6. Dangerous concurrent events create conflicts instead of overwriting local state.
```

HLC update:

```text
send:
  if physical_now_ms > last_physical_ms: counter = 0
  else counter++
  if counter overflows 16 bits: physical_ms++, counter = 0

receive:
  reject remote timestamps beyond the configured max clock skew
  physical_ms = max(local_physical_ms, remote_physical_ms, physical_now_ms)
  counter follows the standard HLC max/tie rule, with the same overflow guard
```

The HLC implementation is mutex-protected for concurrent daemon/agent use. Local outgoing events are stamped through the state store, which persists `(last_hlc, next_seq)` per device in the same SQLite transaction that inserts the event. If the persisted clock row is missing, startup/event creation seeds from `MAX(hlc)` and `MAX(seq)` for the local device so restarts cannot regress or reuse local timestamps. The `(hlc, device_id)` pair is the deterministic tiebreaker. The device id and workspace id are stable generated identifiers created during `devstrap init`, not hardcoded local rows. Phase 0 enforces one local workspace row, but all workspace-scoped tables still carry `workspace_id` so future pairing can provision the same logical `ws_...` id across devices.

Event types:

```text
workspace.created
device.registered
device.revoked
device.heartbeat
project.added
project.updated
project.renamed
project.deleted
project.restored
repo.remote.changed
env.profile.bound
tooling.profile.bound
agent.policy.bound
draft.snapshot.created
conflict.created
conflict.resolved
```

## Sync protocol

Each device maintains a cursor:

```text
sync_cursors(workspace_id, peer_id, last_hlc_applied, last_seq_applied)
```

Sync loop:

```text
1. push local queued events to Hub
2. pull remote events after the peer cursor
3. verify/decrypt where needed
4. apply events to local SQLite in (hlc, device_id) order
5. reconcile local filesystem
6. write event_delivery and sync_cursors transactionally
7. update device heartbeat
```

If the hub no longer retains events after a cursor, the device must fall back to a full-state snapshot plus cursor reset. Silent divergence is not allowed.

Current implementation includes the local HLC type, persisted local event stamping with per-device sequence numbers, project event constructors, `add`/`scan --adopt` project-event emission, local previous-event hash linking, content-hash and previous-hash verification, transactional event claim plus side-effect apply, hash-chain break conflict recording, HLC-gated project delete tombstones/restores, deterministic replay order, exact duplicate no-ops, divergent duplicate rejection, order-independent same-path/different-remote conflict reconciliation, a file-backed hub adapter, and a user-facing `devstrap sync --hub-file <path>` command for the file-backed test hub. Production peer authentication, remote device registration, encrypted payload handling, tombstone garbage collection, full snapshot exchange, and real cross-root skeleton reconciliation remain future work.

## Tombstones and deletes

Deletes create HLC-stamped tombstones instead of immediate purges:

```text
project.deleted -> namespace_entries.status=deleted, tombstone_hlc=<event hlc>
```

Incoming `project.added` or `project.restored` events older than the tombstone are ignored. Tombstones can be garbage-collected only after every approved device cursor has advanced beyond the tombstone HLC and the local filesystem is clean or quarantined.

## Conflict detection

Conflict handling is a pure reconciliation function:

```text
Reconcile(local, incoming) -> updated entry OR conflict record
```

The MVP assumes a single writer per path: for the primary persona (one developer with multiple owned devices) a given namespace path is normally mutated on one device at a time. Under that assumption the path/remote conflict class is detect-only — DevStrap surfaces it and never auto-merges — while the safe-automatic class defined in `spec/03` (duplicate skeleton creation, heartbeat latest-wins, recreate-missing-skeleton) may still be resolved without prompting.

Detectors:

- same normalized path with different remotes;
- concurrent renames from the same source;
- delete event against a dirty local checkout;
- add/restore older than a tombstone;
- remote/default-branch changes concurrent with local edits.

On dangerous conflicts, write a `conflicts` row and never auto-overwrite local files. For same-path/different-remote namespace events, the active entry is selected by the canonical event order `(hlc, device_id, event_id)` and the conflict identity is keyed by `path + sorted(remote_key_a, remote_key_b)`. `created_at` is display-only and must not affect the winner.

## Hub storage

Hub stores:

- append-only events;
- device records;
- encrypted env bundles;
- encrypted draft snapshots;
- sync cursors;
- conflict records.

Hub does not store:

- plaintext secrets;
- raw hydrated Git repos;
- dependency folders;
- private keys.

## Hub deployment options

### Option A — Home hub

Run `devstraphub` on Mac Mini or GMK Ubuntu box.

Pros:

- quick for personal use;
- private;
- good for home-lab workflow;
- can be backed up by NAS.

Cons:

- remote access setup needed;
- hub availability tied to home network unless exposed securely.

### Option B — VPS/cloud hub

Run small service on a VPS.

Pros:

- always available;
- easier for cloud agents;
- path to SaaS.

Cons:

- hosting/security burden.

### Option C — Object-store backend

Use encrypted event/blob files in object storage.

Pros:

- simple infrastructure;
- cheap;
- durable.

Cons:

- conflict handling and locking are harder;
- less real-time.

### Option D — Hidden Git backend

Use a private implementation repo for events/manifest.

Pros:

- very fast MVP;
- free remote transport;
- easy audit.

Cons:

- psychologically conflicts with the product promise;
- Git merge conflicts return;
- should not be the long-term user-facing model.

Recommendation:

```text
Phase 1: local-only SQLite.
Phase 2: home-hub HTTP event log.
Phase 3: hosted hub or object-store adapter.
```

## Conflict model

Conflict is a first-class state.

Do not auto-resolve dangerous cases.

### Conflict: same path different remote

Example:

```text
work/api → git@github.com:acme/api.git
work/api → git@github.com:personal/api.git
```

Resolution options:

```text
keep local
use remote
rename one project
mark one unmanaged
```

Current sync replay records the source event coordinates on the active namespace entry. If a competing same-path remote arrives in a later pull window, replay re-evaluates the pair and promotes the lowest `(hlc, device_id, event_id)` winner, then writes the same stable conflict details regardless of arrival order. This is an interim deterministic default; the conflict remains open until a user chooses the final resolution.

### Conflict: same remote multiple paths

Example:

```text
work/api → git@github.com:acme/api.git
work/acme/api → git@github.com:acme/api.git
```

Resolution options:

```text
choose canonical path
move local clone
leave duplicate unmanaged
```

### Conflict: delete vs dirty local

Rule:

```text
Never delete dirty local clone.
Move to quarantine or keep unmanaged.
```

## Delete semantics

Namespace deletion creates a tombstone.

```text
project.deleted event → skeleton removed on clean devices
hydrated dirty devices → mark pending_delete_conflict
hydrated clean devices → move to quarantine, then purge later
```

Quarantine default retention:

```text
30 days
```

## Rename semantics

Rename is metadata-first.

```text
project.renamed old_path new_path
```

On each device:

- if skeleton: rename folder;
- if hydrated clean: move folder;
- if hydrated dirty: mark conflict;
- if target path exists: mark conflict.

## Draft sync model

Draft project snapshot:

```text
scan draft folder
apply ignore rules
create tar stream
encrypt for approved devices
upload encrypted blob
emit draft.snapshot.created event
```

Restore:

```text
download encrypted blob
decrypt locally
extract to skeleton path
preserve metadata where possible
```

Draft conflict rule:

```text
If two devices modify the same draft offline, create two snapshots and require manual merge.
```

## Namespace snapshot export

Support disaster recovery:

```bash
devstrap export --output devstrap-workspace-20260623.tar.age
```

Contains:

- namespace entries;
- device records;
- profiles;
- ignore rules;
- encrypted env bundles if requested;
- draft snapshots if requested.
